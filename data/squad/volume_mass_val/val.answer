thermodynamics 
the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studied 
the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time 
a property of a physical body 
of an object 's resistance to acceleration ( a change in its state of motion ) when a net force is applied 
kilogram 
by measuring the object 's weight using a spring scale , rather than comparing it directly with known masses 
less 
the lower gravity 
a force 
the amount of matter in an object 
its acceleration in the presence of an applied force 
the same properties of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively 
the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field

one cubic decimeter of water at the melting point of ice 
as the mass of the international prototype kilogram 
in terms of the Planck constant 
at least seven 
a measure of an object 's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied 
by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force 
more 
a measure of the strength of an object 's gravitational flux ( gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface ) 
by allowing a small " test object "  to fall freely and measuring its free-fall acceleration 
because the Moon has less active gravitational mass 
a measure of the strength of an object 's interaction with a gravitational field 
by dividing an object 's weight by its free-fall acceleration 
the same

Pair production and nuclear fusion 
a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass 
Curvature of spacetime 
Such curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure 
measure less time ( run slower ) 
using the Gravity Probe B satellite 
as a difference between an object 's quantum frequency and its wave number 
through various forms of spectroscopy and is closely related to the Rydberg constant , the Bohr radius , and the classical electron radius 
using a Watt balance
