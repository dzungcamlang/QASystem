Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface , for example , the space that a substance ( solid , liquid , gas , or plasma ) or shape occupies or contains . Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit , the cubic metre . The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container , i . e . the amount of fluid ( gas or liquid ) that the container could hold , rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces .

Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes . Volumes of some simple shapes , such as regular , straight-edged , and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas . Volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape 's boundary . Where a variance in shape and volume occurs , such as those that exist between different human beings , these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the Body Volume Index . One-dimensional figures ( such as lines ) and two-dimensional shapes ( such as squares ) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space .

The volume of a solid ( whether regularly or irregularly shaped ) can be determined by fluid displacement . Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas . The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances . However , sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive .

In differential geometry , volume is expressed by means of the volume form , and is an important global Riemannian invariant . In thermodynamics , volume is a fundamental parameter , and is a conjugate variable to pressure . Any unit of length gives a corresponding unit of volume : the volume of a cube whose sides have the given length . For example , a cubic centimetre ( cm3 ) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one centimetre ( 1 cm ) in length . In the International System of Units ( SI ) , the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre ( m3 ) . The metric system also includes the litre ( L ) as a unit of volume , where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube . Thus 1 litre = ( 10 cm )3 = 1000 cubic centimetres = 0.001 cubic metres , so 1 cubic metre = 1000 litres . Small amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres , where 1 millilitre = 0.001 litres = 1 cubic centimetre .

Capacity is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as " the measure applied to the content of a vessel , and to liquids , grain , or the like , which take the shape of that which holds them " . ( The word capacity has other unrelated meanings , as in e.g. capacity management . ) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume , though closely related ; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior . Units of capacity are the SI litre and its derived units , and Imperial units such as gill , pint , gallon , and others . Units of volume are the cubes of units of length . In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related : one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre , the capacity of a cube with a 10 cm side . In other systems the conversion is not trivial ; the capacity of a vehicle 's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet , for example , but in gallons ( a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft ) .

In physics , mass is a property of a physical body . It is the measure of an object 's resistance to acceleration ( a change in its state of motion ) when a net force is applied . It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies . The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram ( kg ) .

Mass is not the same as weight , even though mass is often determined by measuring the object 's weight using a spring scale , rather than comparing it directly with known masses . An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity , but it would still have the same mass . This is because weight is a force , while mass is the property that ( along with gravity ) determines the strength of this force .

In Newtonian physics , mass can be generalized as the amount of matter in an object . However , at very high speeds , special relativity postulates that energy becomes a significant additional source of mass . Thus , any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy , and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction . In addition , " matter "  is a loosely defined term in science , and thus cannot be precisely measured .
The mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force . The inertia and the inertial mass describe the same properties of physical bodies at the qualitative and quantitative level respectively , by other words , the mass quantitatively describes the inertia . According to Newton 's second law of motion , if a body of fixed mass m is subjected to a single force F , its acceleration a is given by F/m . A body 's mass also determines the degree to which it generates or is affected by a gravitational field . If a first body of mass mA is placed at a distance r ( center of mass to center of mass ) from a second body of mass mB , each body is subject to an attractive force Fg = GmAmB/r2, where G = 6.67×10−11 N kg−2 m2 is the " universal gravitational constant " . This is sometimes referred to as gravitational mass . Repeated experiments since the 17th century have demonstrated that inertial and gravitational mass are identical ; since 1915, this observation has been entailed a priori in the equivalence principle of general relativity .

The standard International System of Units ( SI ) unit of mass is the kilogram ( kg ) . The kilogram is 1000 grams ( g ) , first defined in 1795 as one cubic decimeter of water at the melting point of ice . Then in 1889, the kilogram was redefined as the mass of the international prototype kilogram , and as such is independent of the meter , or the properties of water . As of January 2013, there are several proposals for redefining the kilogram yet again , including a proposal for defining it in terms of the Planck constant .

In physical science , one may distinguish conceptually between at least seven different aspects of mass , or seven physical notions that involve the concept of mass : Every experiment to date has shown these seven values to be proportional , and in some cases equal , and this proportionality gives rise to the abstract concept of mass .
Inertial mass is a measure of an object 's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied . It is determined by applying a force to an object and measuring the acceleration that results from that force . An object with small inertial mass will accelerate more than an object with large inertial mass when acted upon by the same force . One says the body of greater mass has greater inertia .

Active gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object 's gravitational flux ( gravitational flux is equal to the surface integral of gravitational field over an enclosing surface ) . Gravitational field can be measured by allowing a small " test object "  to fall freely and measuring its free-fall acceleration . For example , an object in free fall near the Moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field , and hence accelerates more slowly , than the same object would if it were in free fall near the Earth . The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less active gravitational mass .

For example , an object in free fall near the Moon is subject to a smaller gravitational field , and hence accelerates more slowly , than the same object would if it were in free fall near the Earth . The gravitational field near the Moon is weaker because the Moon has less active gravitational mass .
Passive gravitational mass is a measure of the strength of an object 's interaction with a gravitational field . Passive gravitational mass is determined by dividing an object 's weight by its free-fall acceleration . Two objects within the same gravitational field will experience the same acceleration ; however , the object with a smaller passive gravitational mass will experience a smaller force ( less weight ) than the object with a larger passive gravitational mass .

Energy also has mass according to the principle of mass–energy equivalence . This equivalence is exemplified in a large number of physical processes including pair production , nuclear fusion , and the gravitational bending of light . Pair production and nuclear fusion are processes in which measurable amounts of mass are converted to energy , or vice versa . In the gravitational bending of light , photons of pure energy are shown to exhibit a behavior similar to passive gravitational mass .

Curvature of spacetime is a relativistic manifestation of the existence of mass . Such curvature is extremely weak and difficult to measure . For this reason , curvature was not discovered until after it was predicted by Einstein 's theory of general relativity . Extremely precise atomic clocks on the surface of the Earth , for example , are found to measure less time ( run slower ) when compared to similar clocks in space . This difference in elapsed time is a form of curvature called gravitational time dilation . Other forms of curvature have been measured using the Gravity Probe B satellite .

Quantum mass manifests itself as a difference between an object 's quantum frequency and its wave number . The quantum mass of an electron , the Compton wavelength , can be determined through various forms of spectroscopy and is closely related to the Rydberg constant , the Bohr radius , and the classical electron radius . The quantum mass of larger objects can be directly measured using a Watt balance . In relativistic quantum mechanics , mass is one of the irreducible representation labels of the Poincaré group .
