According to a demographic analysis reported by Peter Harvey ( 2013 ) : Mahayana has 360 million adherents ; Theravada has 150 million adherents ; and Vajrayana has 18,2 million adherents . Seven million additional Buddhists are found outside of Asia .
The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches , which had developed some different disciplines and practices , underwent its own process of codification , resulting in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches promulgated in 1990 by Pope John Paul II .
Some powerful Polish nobles were referred to as " magnates " ( Polish singular : " magnat " , plural : " magnaci " ) and " możny " ( " magnate " , " oligarch " ; plural : " możni " ) ; see Magnates of Poland and Lithuania .
Kuaiji Commandery was the initial power base for Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu 's rebellion against the Qin Empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but eventually fell to the Han . Under the Later Han , control of the area returned to the settlement below Mount Kuaiji but authority over the Minyue hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures .
Increasingly , more modern games such as video games and slot machines are provided . Pubs hold special events , from tournaments of the aforementioned games to karaoke nights to pub quizzes . Some play pop music and hip-hop ( dance bar ) , or show football and rugby union on big screen televisions ( sports bar ) . Shove ha'penny and Bat and trap were also popular in pubs south of London .
There is a sizable Somali community in the United Arab Emirates . Somali-owned businesses line the streets of Deira , the Dubai city centre , with only Iranians exporting more products from the city at large . Internet cafés , hotels , coffee shops , restaurants and import-export businesses are all testimony to the Somalis ' entrepreneurial spirit . Star African Air is also one of three Somali-owned airlines which are based in Dubai .
There were 15,504 households , of which 27.3 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 25.9 % were married couples living together , 22.2 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 44.8 % were non-families . 37.5 % of all households were made up of individuals , and 14.3 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.34 .
The Ministry of Defence is one of the United Kingdom 's largest landowners , owning 227,300 hectares of land and foreshore ( either freehold or leasehold ) at April 2014 , which was valued at " about £20 billion " . The MoD also has " rights of access " to a further 222,000 hectares . In total , this is about 1.8 % of the UK land mass . The total annual cost to support the defence estate is " in excess of £3.3 billion " .
Beginning in 1979 , Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Olusegun Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of Shehu Shagari . The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society . The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime 's fraudulent re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development . Buhari promised major reforms , but his government fared little better than its predecessor . His regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985 .
Agricultural production on the island is difficult given the dry and rocky terrain , but the early settlers managed to produce vegetables , cotton , pineapples , salt , bananas and also fishing . Sweet potato is also grown in patches . The islanders developed commerce through the port of Gustavia . Duty-free port attractions , retail trade , high-end tourism ( mostly from North America ) and its luxury hotels and villas have increased the island 's prosperity , reflected in the high standard of living of its citizens .
Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation , typically between hosts on a network . For instance , programs such as Carnivore and NarusInsight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers . Even machines that operate as a closed system ( i.e. , with no contact to the outside world ) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electro-magnetic transmissions generated by the hardware ; TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks .
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .
In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .
The initial near-complete MPEG-1 standard ( parts 1 , 2 and 3 ) was publicly available on 6 December 1991 as ISO CD 11172 . In most countries , patents can not be filed after prior art has been made public , and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date , which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries . As a result , patents required to implement MP3 expired in most countries by December 2012 , 21 years after the publication of ISO CD 11172 .
The Kushan Empire , a collection of Yuezhi tribes , took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , and Manichaeism were all practiced in the region . Later the Hephthalite Empire , a collection of nomadic tribes , moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century . Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads , linking China , the steppes to the north , and the Islamic heartland .
Loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire . Loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas . However loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently . They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do , and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise . However they have low radiation resistance , and so are inefficient for transmitting . They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies , and also as direction finding antennas .
The metal 's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers . The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion , thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering . It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts , depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain . Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished ' to embark a particular look , feel , and/or color . Finishes include mechanical surface treatments , chemical coloring , and coatings .
The 7th and 6th centuries BC witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads . Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta ( conclusion of the Vedas ) . The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual . Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death .
In 1993 , the newly formed government of Namibia received funding from the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) through its Living in a Finite Environment ( LIFE ) Project . The Ministry of Environment and Tourism with the financial support from organisations such as USAID , Endangered Wildlife Trust , WWF , and Canadian Ambassador 's Fund , together form a Community Based Natural Resource Management ( CBNRM ) support structure . The main goal of this project is promote sustainable natural resource management by giving local communities rights to wildlife management and tourism .
In 1729 , Nader Shah , a chieftain and military genius from Khorasan , successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders . He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran . During the reign of Nader Shah , Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire , reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the Caucasus , as well as other major parts of the west and central Asia , and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time .
There is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed , and that racial groups can not be biologically defined . Nonetheless , some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits ( e.g . phenotype ) to some degree , and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations , some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings . For this reason , there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation .
Mary is also depicted as being present among the women at the crucifixion during the crucifixion standing near " the disciple whom Jesus loved " along with Mary of Clopas and Mary Magdalene , [ Jn 19:25-26 ] to which list Matthew 27:56 adds " the mother of the sons of Zebedee " , presumably the Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40 . This representation is called a Stabat Mater . While not recorded in the Gospel accounts , Mary cradling the dead body of her son is a common motif in art , called a " pietà " or " pity " .
Other major employers in the city include Ordnance Survey , the UK 's national mapping agency , whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city , opened in February 2011 . The Lloyd 's Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton . The area of Swaythling is home to Ford 's Southampton Assembly Plant , where the majority of their Transit models are manufactured . Closure of the plant in 2013 was announced in 2012 , with the loss of hundreds of jobs .
Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen ( binder ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 % added asphalt/bitumen . This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C ( 410 °F ) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters ( 0.79 inches ) thick .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .
Norfolk Island Hospital is the only medical centre on the island . Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme do not cover Norfolk Island . All visitors to Norfolk Island , including Australians , are recommended to purchase travel insurance . Although the hospital can perform minor surgery , serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia . Air charter transport can cost in the order of A $ 30,000 . For serious emergencies , medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force . The island has one ambulance staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers .
The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication , which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome . The resulting genes ( paralogs ) may then diverge in sequence and in function . Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family . Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity . Sometimes , gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene , or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function ; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes . :7.6
In the early Sumerian Uruk period , the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep , goats , cattle , and pigs were domesticated . They used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and " woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals . ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants ; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields , and the shaduf was already employed for the purpose of irrigation . Plants were also grown in pots or vases . "
Colossus was the world 's first electronic digital programmable computer . It used a large number of valves ( vacuum tubes ) . It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data , but it was not Turing-complete . Nine Mk II Colossi were built ( The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total ) . Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves ( tubes ) , but Mark II with 2400 valves , was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1 , greatly speeding the decoding process .
During this period , the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet 's loadout base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines . Two SSBN " Boomer " squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the Weapons Station , while one SSN attack squadron , Submarine Squadron 4 , and a submarine tender were homeported at the Naval Base . At the 1996 closure of the station 's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic ( POMFLANT ) , over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their UGM-27 Polaris , UGM-73 Poseidon , and UGM-96 Trident I delivery missiles ( SLBM ) were stored and maintained , guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company .
Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot . When Atticus is out of town , Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach . This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church , which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life , as well as Tom Robinson 's . Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage , causing the audience to laugh uproariously . She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume , which saves her life .
Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as " The Queen 's House " . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 .
International pressure led to a ceasefire , and by then 37 % of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north . At the same time , around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots . Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey , in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using American-supplied equipment during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 . There are 1,534 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots missing as a result of the fighting .
While these preparations were underway in the North , there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel , especially at Kaesong and Ongjin , many initiated by the South . The Republic of Korea Army ( ROK Army ) was being trained by the U.S. Korean Military Advisory Group ( KMAG ) . On the eve of war , KMAG 's commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide " target practice " . For his part , Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North , including when American diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June .
To aid customers with defective consoles , Microsoft extended the Xbox 360 's manufacturer 's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a " General Hardware Failure " error report . A " General Hardware Failure " is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red . This error is often known as the " Red Ring of Death " . In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code . The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes .
In 1964 , Turkey tried to invade Cyprus in response to the continuing Cypriot intercommunal violence . But Turkey was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President Lyndon B. Johnson on 5 June , warning that the US would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of Turkish territory . Meanwhile , by 1964 , enosis was a Greek policy that could not be abandoned ; Makarios and the Greek prime minister Georgios Papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and King Constantine wished Cyprus " a speedy union with the mother country " . Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion .
In 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium . This was controversial , with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London , as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final . In defending the move , the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers , although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out . A fan poll by The Guardian in 2013 found 86 % opposition to Wembley semi-finals .
On average , the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on Earth . The greatest annual snowfall level is at Mount Rainier in Washington , at 692 inches ( 1,758 cm ) ; the record there was 1,122 inches ( 2,850 cm ) in the winter of 1971–72 . This record was broken by the Mt . Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which reported 1,140 inches ( 2,896 cm ) of snowfall for the 1998-99 snowfall season . Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade Range are the Wasatch Mountains , near the Great Salt Lake , the San Juan Mountains in Colorado , and the Sierra Nevada , near Lake Tahoe .
St. John 's is the eastern terminus of the Trans-Canada Highway , one of the longest national highways in the world . The divided highway , also known as " Outer Ring Road " in the city , runs just outside the main part of the city , with exits to Pitts Memorial Drive , Topsail Road , Team Gushue Highway , Thorburn Road , Allandale Road , Portugal Cove Road and Torbay Road , providing relatively easy access to neighbourhoods served by those streets . Pitts Memorial Drive runs from Conception Bay South , through the city of Mount Pearl and into downtown St. John 's , with interchanges for Goulds , Water Street and Hamilton Avenue-New Gower Street .
During adolescence , the human body undergoes various physical , physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones , of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol ( an oestrogen ) and , in males , is testosterone . Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later . There is evidence that these steroids act directly not only on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system , including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity . There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system .
Distinguishing motifs of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition , radiating structures , and rhythmic , metric patterns . In this respect , fractal geometry has been a key utility , especially for mosques and palaces . Other features employed as motifs include columns , piers and arches , organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes . The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable . Its usage spans centuries , first appearing in 691 with the construction of the Dome of the Rock mosque , and recurring even up until the 17th century with the Taj Mahal . And as late as the 19th century , Islamic domes had been incorporated into European architecture .
During the 20th century , the county became increasingly urbanised , particularly the southern part . To the existing county boroughs of Barrow-in-Furness , Blackburn , Bolton , Bootle , Burnley , Bury , Liverpool , Manchester , Oldham , Preston , Rochdale , Salford , St Helens and Wigan were added Blackpool ( 1904 ) , Southport ( 1905 ) , and Warrington ( 1900 ) . The county boroughs also had many boundary extensions . The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated , with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – Lees urban district formed a detached part of the administrative county , between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire .
In the early 20th century , Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals , applying principles of physics in nutrition . In 1906 , Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth . In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them , Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that " unsuspected dietetic factors , " other than calories , protein , and minerals , are needed to prevent deficiency diseases . In 1907 , Stephen M. Babcock and Edwin B. Hart conducted the single-grain experiment , which took nearly four years to complete .
The Bourbon Restoration followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814 . The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne . The ensuing period is called the Restoration , following French usage , and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics . The July Monarchy was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution ( or Three Glorious Days ) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848 . The Second Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870 , between the Second Republic and the Third Republic , in France .
Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of King George III . Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820 , and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld . She inherited the throne aged 18 , after her father 's three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children . The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy , in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality .
Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences , singers and conductors , when a work is being sung in a language not known to them . The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances , those inserted into concert programs , and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music . In addition , professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know ( or do not know well ) , and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing .
In 1837 , the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV 's heir in the United Kingdom was female ( Queen Victoria ) . Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . Thus , Hanover passed to William IV 's brother , Ernest Augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war . Despite being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza , Prussia employed Moltke the Elder 's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army . The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover . After the annexation , the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government .
New Haven is a predominantly Roman Catholic city , as the city 's Dominican , Irish , Italian , Mexican , Ecuadorian , and Puerto Rican populations are overwhelmingly Catholic . The city is part of the Archdiocese of Hartford . Jews also make up a considerable portion of the population , as do Black Baptists . There is a growing number of ( mostly Puerto Rican ) Pentecostals as well . There are churches for all major branches of Christianity within the city , multiple store-front churches , ministries ( especially in working-class Latino and Black neighborhoods ) , a mosque , many synagogues ( including two yeshivas ) , and other places of worship ; the level of religious diversity in the city is high .
Plymouth is home to Plymouth Argyle F.C. , who play in the fourth tier of English football league known as Football League Two . The team 's home ground is called Home Park and is located in Central Park . It links itself with the group of English non-conformists that left Plymouth for the New World in 1620 : its nickname is " The Pilgrims " . The city also has four Non-League football clubs ; Plymouth Parkway F.C . who play at Bolitho Park , Elburton Villa F.C . who play at Haye Road , Vospers Oak Villa F.C . who play at Weston Mill and Plymstock United F.C . who play at Deans Cross . All four clubs play in the South West Peninsula League .
Part of the Russian resistance was credited [ by whom ? ] to the deployment of newly invented blockade mines . Perhaps the most influential contributor to the development of naval mining was a Swede resident in Russia , the inventor and civil engineer Immanuel Nobel ( the father of Alfred Nobel ) . Immanuel Nobel helped the Russian war effort by applying his knowledge of industrial explosives , such as nitroglycerin and gunpowder . One account dates modern naval mining from the Crimean War : " Torpedo mines , if I may use this name given by Fulton to self-acting mines underwater , were among the novelties attempted by the Russians in their defences about Cronstadt and Sevastopol " , as one American officer put it in 1860 .
Except for the five species of monotremes ( egg-laying mammals ) , all modern mammals give birth to live young . Most mammals , including the six most species-rich orders , belong to the placental group . The three largest orders in numbers , are first Rodentia : mice , rats , porcupines , beavers , capybaras , and other gnawing mammals ; then Chiroptera : bats ; and then Soricomorpha : shrews , moles and solenodons . The next three orders , depending on the biological classification scheme used , are the Primates including the humans ; the Cetartiodactyla including the whales and the even-toed hoofed mammals ; and the Carnivora , that is , cats , dogs , weasels , bears , seals , and their relatives .
The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold ; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition , an unsusually large proportion of the populations ( 5 % is often cited ) regularly sing in choirs , the Swedish choral director Eric Ericson had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world , and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools ( music schools ) with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day , a system that started with Adolf Fredrik 's Music School in Stockholm in 1939 but has spread over the country .
On March 10 , 2004 , Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City . Bush accepted the nomination on September 2 , 2004 , and selected Vice President Dick Cheney as his running mate . ( In New York , the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the Conservative Party of New York State . ) During the convention and throughout the campaign , Bush focused on two themes : defending America against terrorism and building an ownership society . The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their Social Security in the stock market , increasing home and stock ownership , and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance .
Miami has a tropical monsoon climate ( Köppen climate classification Am ) with hot and humid summers and short , warm winters , with a marked drier season in the winter . Its sea-level elevation , coastal location , position just above the Tropic of Cancer , and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate . With January averaging 67.2 °F ( 19.6 °C ) , winter features mild to warm temperatures ; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front , which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season . Lows occasionally fall below 50 °F ( 10 °C ) , but very rarely below 35 °F ( 2 °C ) . Highs generally range between 70–77 °F ( 21–25 °C ) .
Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders include both extant groups , their stem groups , and a number of Paleozoic groups , now extinct . During this era , some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) , making them far larger than any living insect . This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today . The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor . Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago . Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth , around 252 million years ago .
The Oak Street Connector ( Connecticut Route 34 ) intersects I-91 at exit 1 , just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange , and runs northwest for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto surface roads . The Wilbur Cross Parkway ( Connecticut Route 15 ) runs parallel to I-95 west of New Haven , turning northwards as it nears the city and then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven and Hamden , offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey ( restricted to non-commercial vehicles ) . Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only highway tunnel in the state ( officially designated as Heroes Tunnel ) , running through West Rock , home to West Rock Park and the Three Judges Cave .
More detail was given in Darwin 's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication , which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis . Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance , he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population . However , inherited variation could be seen , and Darwin 's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable . It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation . This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin 's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel 's theories of genetic inheritance .
Starting in 1910 , the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft . In 1910 , Mexico was having a civil war , peasant rebels fighting government soldiers . The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property . In 1916 , Pancho Villa , a major rebel leader , attacked Columbus , New Mexico , prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917 . They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918 . The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain , France , Russia , Italy and other allies . U.S. troops were sent to the Western Front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war . With the armistice in November 1918 , the army once again decreased its forces .
Encouraged by these successes , Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market . Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari ’ s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System . The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983 . However , Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo 's Donkey Kong game . This violation of Atari 's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo 's game console marketing contract with Atari . Atari 's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month , so the deal went nowhere , and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g [ › ]
The formal structure of the Qing government centered on the Emperor as the absolute ruler , who presided over six Boards ( Ministries [ c ] ) , each headed by two presidents [ d ] and assisted by four vice presidents . [ e ] In contrast to the Ming system , however , Qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations . The Grand Secretariat , [ f ] which had been an important policy-making body under the Ming , lost its importance during the Qing and evolved into an imperial chancery . The institutions which had been inherited from the Ming formed the core of the Qing " Outer Court , " which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the Forbidden City .
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of R & D units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the INETI – Instituto Nacional de Engenharia , Tecnologia e Inovação and the INRB – Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos . The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science , Technology and Higher Education ( MCTES ) itself and the MCTES 's Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia ( FCT ) . The largest R & D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications , include biosciences research institutions like the Instituto de Medicina Molecular , the Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology , the IPATIMUP , the Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular and the Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute .
After the Partisans managed to endure and avoid these intense Axis attacks between January and June 1943 , and the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident , Allied leaders switched their support from Draža Mihailović to Tito . King Peter II , American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in officially recognising Tito and the Partisans at the Tehran Conference . This resulted in Allied aid being parachuted behind Axis lines to assist the Partisans . On 17 June 1944 on the Dalmatian island of Vis , the Treaty of Vis ( Viški sporazum ) was signed in an attempt to merge Tito 's government ( the AVNOJ ) with the government in exile of King Peter II . The Balkan Air Force was formed in June 1944 to control operations that were mainly aimed at aiding his forces .
Possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , the pace of executions picked up , reaching a peak of 98 in 1999 and then they declined gradually to 28 in 2015 . Since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976 , 1,411 people have been executed , almost exclusively by the states , with most occurring after 1990 . Texas has accounted for over one-third of modern executions ( although only two death sentences were imposed in Texas during 2015 , with the courts preferring to issue sentences of life without parole instead ) and over four times as many as Oklahoma , the state with the second-highest number . California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row , has issued the highest number of death sentences but has held relatively few executions .
There are two broad categories of public funding , direct , which entails a monetary transfer to a party , and indirect , which includes broadcasting time on state media , use of the mail service or supplies . According to the Comparative Data from the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network , out of a sample of over 180 nations , 25 % of nations provide no direct or indirect public funding , 58 % provide direct public funding and 60 % of nations provide indirect public funding . Some countries provide both direct and indirect public funding to political parties . Funding may be equal for all parties or depend on the results of previous elections or the number of candidates participating in an election . Frequently parties rely on a mix of private and public funding and are required to disclose their finances to the Election management body .
Energy sources unsuitable for mobile power plants , such as nuclear power , renewable hydroelectricity , or wind power can be used . According to widely accepted global energy reserve statistics , the reserves of liquid fuel are much less than gas and coal ( at 42 , 167 and 416 years respectively ) . Most countries with large rail networks do not have significant oil reserves and those that did , like the United States and Britain , have exhausted much of their reserves and have suffered declining oil output for decades . Therefore , there is also a strong economic incentive to substitute other fuels for oil . Rail electrification is often considered an important route towards consumption pattern reform . However , there are no reliable , peer-reviewed studies available to assist in rational public debate on this critical issue , although there are untranslated Soviet studies from the 1980s .

The return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory . Arsenal won the League Cup in 1987 , Graham 's first season in charge . This was followed by a League title win in 1988–89 , won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool . Graham 's Arsenal won another title in 1990–91 , losing only one match , won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993 , and a second European trophy , the European Cup Winners ' Cup , in 1994 . Graham 's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players , and he was dismissed in 1995 . His replacement , Bruce Rioch , lasted for only one season , leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors .
In ancient India , literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted . Early genres included drama , fables , sutras and epic poetry . Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas , dating back to 1500–1000 BCE , and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India . The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts . The Samhitas ( vedic collections ) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE , and the " circum-Vedic " texts , as well as the redaction of the Samhitas , date to c. 1000-500 BCE , resulting in a Vedic period , spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE , or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age . The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BC saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics , the Mahabharata and the Ramayana , with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD .

In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office .
The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of containment of Communism in south Asia , but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles , corruption and incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam , and ever increasing protests at home . The Tet Offensive in 1968 , although a major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated , marked the psychological turning point in the war . With President Richard M. Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving détente with both the Soviet Union and China , American policy shifted to " Vietnamization , " – providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves . After more than 57,000 dead and many more wounded , American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory , and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified .
The armillary sphere , a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere , was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC . Using a water clock , waterwheel and a series of gears , the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78–139 AD ) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere . To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock , Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel . Zhang also invented a seismometer ( Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪 ) in 132 AD to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away . This employed an inverted pendulum that , when disturbed by ground tremors , would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths ( representing all eight directions ) into a metal toad 's mouth .
The 1903 advent of heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of an airplane , made from the deck of a United States Navy vessel ( cruiser USS Birmingham ) , and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911 . On 9 May 1912 the first airplane take-off from a ship underway was made from the deck of the British Royal Navy 's HMS Hibernia . Seaplane tender support ships came next , with the French Foudre of 1911 . In September 1914 the Imperial Japanese Navy Wakamiya conducted the world 's first successful ship-launched air raid : on 6 September 1914 a Farman aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar in Kiaochow Bay off Tsingtao ; neither was hit . The first carrier-launched airstrike was the Tondern Raid in July 1918 . Seven Sopwith Camels launched from the converted battlecruiser HMS Furious damaged the German airbase at Tønder and destroyed two zeppelins .
Villa and Carranza had different political goals causing Villa to become an enemy of Carranza . After Carranza took control in 1914 , Villa and other revolutionaries who opposed him met at what was called the Convention of Aguascalientes . The convention deposed Carranza in favor of Eulalio Gutiérrez . In the winter of 1914 Villa 's and Zapata 's troops entered and occupied Mexico City . Villa was forced from the city in early 1915 and attacked the forces of Gen. Obregón at the Battle of Celaya and was badly defeated in the bloodiest battle of the revolution , with thousands dead . With the defeat of Villa , Carranza seized power . A short time later the United States recognized Carranza as president of Mexico . Even though Villa 's forces were badly depleted by his loss at Celaya , he continued his fight against the Carranza government . Finally , in 1920 , Obregón—who had defeated him at Celaya—finally reached an agreement with Villa end his rebellion .
Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE . From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish . Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries . Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the Gupta Empire stands out . This period , witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " Golden Age of India " . During this period , aspects of Indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( Hinduism and Buddhism ) spread to much of Asia , while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE . Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia ( Greater India ) .
In 1978 , Queen toured the US and Canada , and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan . They released their first live album , Live Killers , in 1979 ; it went platinum twice in the US . Queen also released the very successful single " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " , a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley . The song made the top 10 in many countries , topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks , and was the band 's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks . Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record , Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live , which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert . In December 1979 , Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London , having accepted a request by the event 's organiser Paul McCartney .
Carrying a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back , West crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time . He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident . Once he had completed the album , it was leaked months before its release date . However , West decided to use the opportunity to review the album , and The College Dropout was significantly remixed , remastered , and revised before being released . As a result , certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted , among them " Keep the Receipt " with Ol ' Dirty Bastard and " The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly " with Consequence . West meticulously refined the production , adding string arrangements , gospel choirs , improved drum programming and new verses . West 's perfectionism led The College Dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003 .
During the middle decades of the 18th century , there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent , the Carnatic Wars , as the English East India Company ( the Company ) and its French counterpart , the Compagnie française des Indes orientales , struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire . The Battle of Plassey in 1757 , in which the British , led by Robert Clive , defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies , left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India . France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states , ending French hopes of controlling India . In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control , either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army , the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys .

Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi , a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya . His family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa , who were Arabized Berber in heritage . His father , Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad , was known as Abu Meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named Aisha ( died 1978 ) ; Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . Nomadic Bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . As such , Gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . His parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . Gaddafi 's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
The South Atlantic Express , a 10,000 km ( 6,214 mi ) submarine communications cable connecting Africa to South America , run by the undersea fibre optic provider eFive , will pass St Helena relatively closely . There were no plans to land the cable and install a landing station ashore , which could supply St Helena 's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today 's Information Society . In January 2012 , a group of supporters petitioned the UK government to meet the cost of landing the cable at St Helena . On 6 October 2012 , eFive agreed to reroute the cable through St. Helena after a successful lobbying campaign by A Human Right , a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people are connected to the Internet . Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to bridge the connection from a local junction box on the cable to the island . The UK Government have announced that a review of the island 's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed to .
The sensors are primarily single cells that detect light , chemicals , pressure waves and contact , and are present on the head , appendages ( if any ) and other parts of the body . Nuchal ( " on the neck " ) organs are paired , ciliated structures found only in polychaetes , and are thought to be chemosensors . Some polychaetes also have various combinations of ocelli ( " little eyes " ) that detect the direction from which light is coming and camera eyes or compound eyes that can probably form images . The compound eyes probably evolved independently of arthropods ' eyes . Some tube-worms use ocelli widely spread over their bodies to detect the shadows of fish , so that they can quickly withdraw into their tubes . Some burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes have statocysts ( tilt and balance sensors ) that tell them which way is down . A few polychaete genera have on the undersides of their heads palps that are used both in feeding and as " feelers " , and some of these also have antennae that are structurally similar but probably are used mainly as " feelers " .
There are several other important art museums in Montevideo . The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rodó has Uruguay 's largest collection of paintings . The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930 , the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay , significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes . In back of the museum is a beautiful Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp . The Museo de Historia del Arte , located in the Palacio Municipal , features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt , Mesopotamia , Persia , Greece , Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period . The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial , in the Ciudad Vieja , has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei . These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America , painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico , Peru and Brazil . The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture .
The thorax is a tagma composed of three sections , the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax . The anterior segment , closest to the head , is the prothorax , with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum . The middle segment is the mesothorax , with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings . The third and most posterior segment , abutting the abdomen , is the metathorax , which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings . Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture . Each segment has four basic regions . The dorsal surface is called the tergum ( or notum ) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga . The two lateral regions are called the pleura ( singular : pleuron ) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum . In turn , the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum , the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum . Continuing with this logic , the mesopleura and metapleura , as well as the mesosternum and metasternum , are used .
Between April 1877 and February 1878 , she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War , but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin . Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy , which Victoria endorsed , led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War . " If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power " , she wrote , " we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars , somewhere or other , CONTINUALLY . " Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign , protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers : " It is not in our custom to annexe countries " , she said , " unless we are obliged & forced to do so . " To Victoria 's dismay , Disraeli lost the 1880 general election , and Gladstone returned as prime minister . When Disraeli died the following year , she was blinded by " fast falling tears " , and erected a memorial tablet " placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend , Victoria R.I . "
Residents of Norfolk Island do not pay Australian federal taxes , creating a tax haven for locals and visitors alike . Because there is no income tax , the island 's legislative assembly raises money through an import duty , fuel levy , medicare levy , GST of 12 % and local/international phone calls . In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island , David Buffett , announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts . The introduction of income taxation will now come into effect on July 1 , 2016 , with a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island 's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool so that the island can have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health , education , medicare , and infrastructure . Prior to these reforms residents of Norfolk Island were not entitled to social services . It appears that the reforms do extend to companies and trustees and not only individuals .
The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II , because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare . The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft . They had higher range and precision than naval guns , making them highly effective . The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto , signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes . This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers . World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets . The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers . Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about , as no other nation had fielded anything comparable . However , the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940 .
Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk , a blend of 18th-century English and Tahitian . The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons ; however , there are efforts to keep it alive via dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents . In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island . The act is long-titled : " An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language ( Norf'k ) as an official language of Norfolk Island . " The " language known as 'Norf'k ' " is described as the language " that is spoken by descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island " . The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it ; in official use , it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English . 32 % of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census , and just under three-quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk .
Maternal factors also play a role in the body ’ s immune response . At birth , most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG . Because IgM , IgD , IgE and IgA don ’ t cross the placenta , they are almost undetectable at birth . Some IgA is provided by breast milk . These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months , but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity . These antibodies can also produce a negative response . If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response . Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization . Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults , and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates . Between six to nine months after birth , a child ’ s immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins , but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old . This can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules .
The Emperor Diocletian ( r. 284–305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other . [ C ] In 330 , after a period of civil war , Constantine the Great ( r. 306–337 ) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital , Constantinople . Diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy , reformed taxation , and strengthened the army , which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation , a declining birthrate , and pressures on its frontiers , among others . Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century , diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach . For much of the 4th century , Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between the rich and poor , and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns . Another change was the Christianisation , or conversion of the empire to Christianity , a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries .
Madonna also began work on her thirteenth studio album , with collaborators including Avicii , Diplo and Natalia Kills . In December 2014 , thirteen demos recorded for the album leaked onto the Internet . She posted in response that half of the tracks would not be used on the final release , while the other half had " changed and evolved " . The album , titled Rebel Heart , was released on March 10 , 2015 . From September 2015 , she embarked on the Rebel Heart Tour to promote the album ; the tour ended in March 2016 and traveled throughout North America , Europe and Asia and was the singer 's first visit to Australia in 23 years , where she also performed a one-off show for her fans . It grossed a total of $ 169.8 million from the 82 shows , with over 1.045 million ticket sales . While on tour Madonna became embroiled in a legal battle with Ritchie , over the custody of her son Rocco . The dispute started when Rocco decided to continue living at England with Ritchie when the Rebel Heart Tour had visited there , while Madonna wanted him to return with her . Court hearings took place in both New York and London , and after multiple deliberations , Madonna decided to withdraw her application for custody , and appealed for a mutual discussion between herself and Ritchie about Rocco .
The FBI is near-impenetrable , with applicants intensely scrutinized and assessed over an extended period . To apply to become an FBI agent , one must be between the ages of 23 and 37 . Due to the decision in Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management , 2008 M.S.P.B . 146 , preference-eligible veterans may apply after age 37 . In 2009 , the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision . The applicant must also hold American citizenship , be of high moral character , have a clean record , and hold at least a four-year bachelor 's degree . At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required . All FBI employees require a Top Secret ( TS ) security clearance , and in many instances , employees need a TS/SCI ( Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information ) clearance . To obtain a security clearance , all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations ( SSBI ) , which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management . Special Agents candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test ( PFT ) , which includes a 300-meter run , one-minute sit-ups , maximum push-ups , and a 1.5-mile ( 2.4 km ) run . Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use . Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI .
Detroit and the rest of southeastern Michigan have a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ) which is influenced by the Great Lakes ; the city and close-in suburbs are part of USDA Hardiness zone 6b , with farther-out northern and western suburbs generally falling in zone 6a . Winters are cold , with moderate snowfall and temperatures not rising above freezing on an average 44 days annually , while dropping to or below 0 °F ( −18 °C ) on an average 4.4 days a year ; summers are warm to hot with temperatures exceeding 90 °F ( 32 °C ) on 12 days . The warm season runs from May to September . The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from 25.6 °F ( −3.6 °C ) in January to 73.6 °F ( 23.1 °C ) in July . Official temperature extremes range from 105 °F ( 41 °C ) on July 24 , 1934 down to −21 °F ( −29 °C ) on January 21 , 1984 ; the record low maximum is −4 °F ( −20 °C ) on January 19 , 1994 , while , conversely the record high minimum is 80 °F ( 27 °C ) on August 1 , 2006 , the most recent of five occurrences . A decade or two may pass between readings of 100 °F ( 38 °C ) or higher , which last occurred July 17 , 2012 . The average window for freezing temperatures is October 20 thru April 22 , allowing a growing season of 180 days .
Prior to 1948 , approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world ( excluding Israel ) . Of these , just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region , 15–20 % in the Kingdom of Iraq , approximately 10 % in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7 % in the Kingdom of Yemen . A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey . Today , around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey . A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century , although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria . The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948 . The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s , primarily in Iraq , Yemen and Libya , with up to 90 % of these communities leaving within a few years . The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 . The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s . Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period , due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries , although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled . In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states , an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80 % of Iranian Jews left the country . [ citation needed ]
In 1954 , major Serbian and Croatian writers , linguists and literary critics , backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement , which in its first conclusion stated : " Serbs , Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb ( western ) and Belgrade ( eastern ) " . The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts , and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations . It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts , while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained . Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary , and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis . During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad . Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism . The evidence supporting this claim is patchy : Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true , but was not proof of unequal rights , but of frequency of use and prestige . Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary ( 1967 ) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed , which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants , and not of unitarism . Moreover , Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists . And finally , Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society . Regardless of these facts , Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967 . On occasion of the publication ’ s 45th anniversary , the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012 , accompanied by a critical analysis .
