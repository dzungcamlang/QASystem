While these preparations were underway in the North , there were frequent clashes along the 38th parallel , especially at Kaesong and Ongjin , many initiated by the South . The Republic of Korea Army ( ROK Army ) was being trained by the U.S. Korean Military Advisory Group ( KMAG ) . On the eve of war , KMAG 's commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK Army and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide " target practice " . For his part , Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North , including when American diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June .
Beginning in 1979 , Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Olusegun Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of Shehu Shagari . The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society . The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime 's fraudulent re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development . Buhari promised major reforms , but his government fared little better than its predecessor . His regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985 .
The Bourbon Restoration followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814 . The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne . The ensuing period is called the Restoration , following French usage , and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics . The July Monarchy was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution ( or Three Glorious Days ) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848 . The Second Empire was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870 , between the Second Republic and the Third Republic , in France .
Possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , the pace of executions picked up , reaching a peak of 98 in 1999 and then they declined gradually to 28 in 2015 . Since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976 , 1,411 people have been executed , almost exclusively by the states , with most occurring after 1990 . Texas has accounted for over one-third of modern executions ( although only two death sentences were imposed in Texas during 2015 , with the courts preferring to issue sentences of life without parole instead ) and over four times as many as Oklahoma , the state with the second-highest number . California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row , has issued the highest number of death sentences but has held relatively few executions .
The return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory . Arsenal won the League Cup in 1987 , Graham 's first season in charge . This was followed by a League title win in 1988–89 , won with a last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool . Graham 's Arsenal won another title in 1990–91 , losing only one match , won the FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993 , and a second European trophy , the European Cup Winners ' Cup , in 1994 . Graham 's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain players , and he was dismissed in 1995 . His replacement , Bruce Rioch , lasted for only one season , leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors .
The sensors are primarily single cells that detect light , chemicals , pressure waves and contact , and are present on the head , appendages ( if any ) and other parts of the body . Nuchal ( " on the neck " ) organs are paired , ciliated structures found only in polychaetes , and are thought to be chemosensors . Some polychaetes also have various combinations of ocelli ( " little eyes " ) that detect the direction from which light is coming and camera eyes or compound eyes that can probably form images . The compound eyes probably evolved independently of arthropods ' eyes . Some tube-worms use ocelli widely spread over their bodies to detect the shadows of fish , so that they can quickly withdraw into their tubes . Some burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes have statocysts ( tilt and balance sensors ) that tell them which way is down . A few polychaete genera have on the undersides of their heads palps that are used both in feeding and as " feelers " , and some of these also have antennae that are structurally similar but probably are used mainly as " feelers " .
Victoria was the daughter of Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of King George III . Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820 , and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld . She inherited the throne aged 18 , after her father 's three elder brothers had all died , leaving no surviving legitimate children . The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy , in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power . Privately , Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments ; publicly , she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality .
Norfolk Island Hospital is the only medical centre on the island . Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme do not cover Norfolk Island . All visitors to Norfolk Island , including Australians , are recommended to purchase travel insurance . Although the hospital can perform minor surgery , serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia . Air charter transport can cost in the order of A $ 30,000 . For serious emergencies , medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force . The island has one ambulance staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers .
Encouraged by these successes , Nintendo soon turned its attention to the North American market . Nintendo entered into negotiations with Atari to release the Famicom under Atari ’ s name as the name Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System . The deal was set to be finalized and signed at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1983 . However , Atari discovered at that show that its competitor Coleco was illegally demonstrating its Coleco Adam computer with Nintendo 's Donkey Kong game . This violation of Atari 's exclusive license with Nintendo to publish the game for its own computer systems delayed the implementation of Nintendo 's game console marketing contract with Atari . Atari 's CEO Ray Kassar was fired the next month , so the deal went nowhere , and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.g [ › ]
During the 20th century , the county became increasingly urbanised , particularly the southern part . To the existing county boroughs of Barrow-in-Furness , Blackburn , Bolton , Bootle , Burnley , Bury , Liverpool , Manchester , Oldham , Preston , Rochdale , Salford , St Helens and Wigan were added Blackpool ( 1904 ) , Southport ( 1905 ) , and Warrington ( 1900 ) . The county boroughs also had many boundary extensions . The borders around the Manchester area were particularly complicated , with narrow protrusions of the administrative county between the county boroughs – Lees urban district formed a detached part of the administrative county , between Oldham county borough and the West Riding of Yorkshire .
Agricultural production on the island is difficult given the dry and rocky terrain , but the early settlers managed to produce vegetables , cotton , pineapples , salt , bananas and also fishing . Sweet potato is also grown in patches . The islanders developed commerce through the port of Gustavia . Duty-free port attractions , retail trade , high-end tourism ( mostly from North America ) and its luxury hotels and villas have increased the island 's prosperity , reflected in the high standard of living of its citizens .
During the middle decades of the 18th century , there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the Indian subcontinent , the Carnatic Wars , as the English East India Company ( the Company ) and its French counterpart , the Compagnie française des Indes orientales , struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the Mughal Empire . The Battle of Plassey in 1757 , in which the British , led by Robert Clive , defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies , left the Company in control of Bengal and as the major military and political power in India . France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states , ending French hopes of controlling India . In the following decades the Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control , either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the British Indian Army , the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys .
Prior to 1948 , approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands which now make up the Arab world ( excluding Israel ) . Of these , just under two-thirds lived in the French-controlled Maghreb region , 15–20 % in the Kingdom of Iraq , approximately 10 % in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7 % in the Kingdom of Yemen . A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey . Today , around 26,000 Jews live in Arab countries and around 30,000 in Iran and Turkey . A small-scale exodus had begun in many countries in the early decades of the 20th century , although the only substantial aliyah came from Yemen and Syria . The exodus from Arab and Muslim countries took place primarily from 1948 . The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s , primarily in Iraq , Yemen and Libya , with up to 90 % of these communities leaving within a few years . The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 . The exodus in the Maghreb countries peaked in the 1960s . Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period , due to an influx of refugees from other Arab countries , although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled . In the aftermath of the exodus wave from Arab states , an additional migration of Iranian Jews peaked in the 1980s when around 80 % of Iranian Jews left the country . [ citation needed ]
There are two broad categories of public funding , direct , which entails a monetary transfer to a party , and indirect , which includes broadcasting time on state media , use of the mail service or supplies . According to the Comparative Data from the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network , out of a sample of over 180 nations , 25 % of nations provide no direct or indirect public funding , 58 % provide direct public funding and 60 % of nations provide indirect public funding . Some countries provide both direct and indirect public funding to political parties . Funding may be equal for all parties or depend on the results of previous elections or the number of candidates participating in an election . Frequently parties rely on a mix of private and public funding and are required to disclose their finances to the Election management body .
In the early 20th century , Carl von Voit and Max Rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals , applying principles of physics in nutrition . In 1906 , Edith G. Willcock and Frederick Hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth . In the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them , Hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that " unsuspected dietetic factors , " other than calories , protein , and minerals , are needed to prevent deficiency diseases . In 1907 , Stephen M. Babcock and Edwin B. Hart conducted the single-grain experiment , which took nearly four years to complete .
Muammar Gaddafi was born in a tent near Qasr Abu Hadi , a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of western Libya . His family came from a small , relatively un-influential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa , who were Arabized Berber in heritage . His father , Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad , was known as Abu Meniar ( died 1985 ) , and his mother was named Aisha ( died 1978 ) ; Abu Meniar earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder . Nomadic Bedouins , they were illiterate and kept no birth records . As such , Gaddafi 's date of birth is not known with certainty , and sources have set it in 1942 or in the spring of 1943 , although biographers Blundy and Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940 . His parents ' only surviving son , he had three older sisters . Gaddafi 's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life . He repeatedly expressed a preference for the desert over the city and retreated to the desert to meditate .
Distinguishing motifs of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition , radiating structures , and rhythmic , metric patterns . In this respect , fractal geometry has been a key utility , especially for mosques and palaces . Other features employed as motifs include columns , piers and arches , organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes . The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable . Its usage spans centuries , first appearing in 691 with the construction of the Dome of the Rock mosque , and recurring even up until the 17th century with the Taj Mahal . And as late as the 19th century , Islamic domes had been incorporated into European architecture .
The Kushan Empire , a collection of Yuezhi tribes , took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , and Manichaeism were all practiced in the region . Later the Hephthalite Empire , a collection of nomadic tribes , moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century . Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads , linking China , the steppes to the north , and the Islamic heartland .
The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of containment of Communism in south Asia , but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles , corruption and incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam , and ever increasing protests at home . The Tet Offensive in 1968 , although a major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated , marked the psychological turning point in the war . With President Richard M. Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving détente with both the Soviet Union and China , American policy shifted to " Vietnamization , " – providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves . After more than 57,000 dead and many more wounded , American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory , and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified .
The 1903 advent of heavier-than-air fixed-wing aircraft was closely followed in 1910 by the first experimental take-off of an airplane , made from the deck of a United States Navy vessel ( cruiser USS Birmingham ) , and the first experimental landings were conducted in 1911 . On 9 May 1912 the first airplane take-off from a ship underway was made from the deck of the British Royal Navy 's HMS Hibernia . Seaplane tender support ships came next , with the French Foudre of 1911 . In September 1914 the Imperial Japanese Navy Wakamiya conducted the world 's first successful ship-launched air raid : on 6 September 1914 a Farman aircraft launched by Wakamiya attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth and the German gunboat Jaguar in Kiaochow Bay off Tsingtao ; neither was hit . The first carrier-launched airstrike was the Tondern Raid in July 1918 . Seven Sopwith Camels launched from the converted battlecruiser HMS Furious damaged the German airbase at Tønder and destroyed two zeppelins .
Loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire . Loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas . However loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently . They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do , and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise . However they have low radiation resistance , and so are inefficient for transmitting . They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies , and also as direction finding antennas .
There were 15,504 households , of which 27.3 % had children under the age of 18 living with them , 25.9 % were married couples living together , 22.2 % had a female householder with no husband present , and 44.8 % were non-families . 37.5 % of all households were made up of individuals , and 14.3 % had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older . The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.34 .
According to a demographic analysis reported by Peter Harvey ( 2013 ) : Mahayana has 360 million adherents ; Theravada has 150 million adherents ; and Vajrayana has 18,2 million adherents . Seven million additional Buddhists are found outside of Asia .
During this period , the Weapons Station was the Atlantic Fleet 's loadout base for all nuclear ballistic missile submarines . Two SSBN " Boomer " squadrons and a submarine tender were homeported at the Weapons Station , while one SSN attack squadron , Submarine Squadron 4 , and a submarine tender were homeported at the Naval Base . At the 1996 closure of the station 's Polaris Missile Facility Atlantic ( POMFLANT ) , over 2,500 nuclear warheads and their UGM-27 Polaris , UGM-73 Poseidon , and UGM-96 Trident I delivery missiles ( SLBM ) were stored and maintained , guarded by a U.S. Marine Corps security force company .
The initial near-complete MPEG-1 standard ( parts 1 , 2 and 3 ) was publicly available on 6 December 1991 as ISO CD 11172 . In most countries , patents can not be filed after prior art has been made public , and patents expire 20 years after the initial filing date , which can be up to 12 months later for filings in other countries . As a result , patents required to implement MP3 expired in most countries by December 2012 , 21 years after the publication of ISO CD 11172 .
The thorax is a tagma composed of three sections , the prothorax , mesothorax and the metathorax . The anterior segment , closest to the head , is the prothorax , with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum . The middle segment is the mesothorax , with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings . The third and most posterior segment , abutting the abdomen , is the metathorax , which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings . Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture . Each segment has four basic regions . The dorsal surface is called the tergum ( or notum ) to distinguish it from the abdominal terga . The two lateral regions are called the pleura ( singular : pleuron ) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum . In turn , the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum , the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum . Continuing with this logic , the mesopleura and metapleura , as well as the mesosternum and metasternum , are used .
According to the traditional narrative , several companions of Muhammad served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations . Shortly after Muhammad 's death , the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it . These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman 's codex , which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today . There are , however , variant readings , with mostly minor differences in meaning .
Villa and Carranza had different political goals causing Villa to become an enemy of Carranza . After Carranza took control in 1914 , Villa and other revolutionaries who opposed him met at what was called the Convention of Aguascalientes . The convention deposed Carranza in favor of Eulalio Gutiérrez . In the winter of 1914 Villa 's and Zapata 's troops entered and occupied Mexico City . Villa was forced from the city in early 1915 and attacked the forces of Gen. Obregón at the Battle of Celaya and was badly defeated in the bloodiest battle of the revolution , with thousands dead . With the defeat of Villa , Carranza seized power . A short time later the United States recognized Carranza as president of Mexico . Even though Villa 's forces were badly depleted by his loss at Celaya , he continued his fight against the Carranza government . Finally , in 1920 , Obregón—who had defeated him at Celaya—finally reached an agreement with Villa end his rebellion .
The armillary sphere , a three-dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere , was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC . Using a water clock , waterwheel and a series of gears , the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78–139 AD ) was able to mechanically rotate his metal-ringed armillary sphere . To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock , Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel . Zhang also invented a seismometer ( Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪 ) in 132 AD to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away . This employed an inverted pendulum that , when disturbed by ground tremors , would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths ( representing all eight directions ) into a metal toad 's mouth .
Except for the five species of monotremes ( egg-laying mammals ) , all modern mammals give birth to live young . Most mammals , including the six most species-rich orders , belong to the placental group . The three largest orders in numbers , are first Rodentia : mice , rats , porcupines , beavers , capybaras , and other gnawing mammals ; then Chiroptera : bats ; and then Soricomorpha : shrews , moles and solenodons . The next three orders , depending on the biological classification scheme used , are the Primates including the humans ; the Cetartiodactyla including the whales and the even-toed hoofed mammals ; and the Carnivora , that is , cats , dogs , weasels , bears , seals , and their relatives .
The South Atlantic Express , a 10,000 km ( 6,214 mi ) submarine communications cable connecting Africa to South America , run by the undersea fibre optic provider eFive , will pass St Helena relatively closely . There were no plans to land the cable and install a landing station ashore , which could supply St Helena 's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today 's Information Society . In January 2012 , a group of supporters petitioned the UK government to meet the cost of landing the cable at St Helena . On 6 October 2012 , eFive agreed to reroute the cable through St. Helena after a successful lobbying campaign by A Human Right , a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people are connected to the Internet . Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to bridge the connection from a local junction box on the cable to the island . The UK Government have announced that a review of the island 's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed to .
Most of the subcontinent was conquered by the Maurya Empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE . From the 3rd century BC onwards Prakrit and Pali literature in the north and the Sangam literature in southern India started to flourish . Wootz steel originated in south India in the 3rd century BC and was exported to foreign countries . Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the Gupta Empire stands out . This period , witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " Golden Age of India " . During this period , aspects of Indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( Hinduism and Buddhism ) spread to much of Asia , while kingdoms in southern India had maritime business links with the Roman Empire from around 77 CE . Indian cultural influence spread over many parts of Southeast Asia which led to the establishment of Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia ( Greater India ) .
In 1729 , Nader Shah , a chieftain and military genius from Khorasan , successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders . He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which were divided among the Ottoman and Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran . During the reign of Nader Shah , Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire , reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the Caucasus , as well as other major parts of the west and central Asia , and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time .
There is a sizable Somali community in the United Arab Emirates . Somali-owned businesses line the streets of Deira , the Dubai city centre , with only Iranians exporting more products from the city at large . Internet cafés , hotels , coffee shops , restaurants and import-export businesses are all testimony to the Somalis ' entrepreneurial spirit . Star African Air is also one of three Somali-owned airlines which are based in Dubai .
Detroit and the rest of southeastern Michigan have a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ) which is influenced by the Great Lakes ; the city and close-in suburbs are part of USDA Hardiness zone 6b , with farther-out northern and western suburbs generally falling in zone 6a . Winters are cold , with moderate snowfall and temperatures not rising above freezing on an average 44 days annually , while dropping to or below 0 °F ( −18 °C ) on an average 4.4 days a year ; summers are warm to hot with temperatures exceeding 90 °F ( 32 °C ) on 12 days . The warm season runs from May to September . The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from 25.6 °F ( −3.6 °C ) in January to 73.6 °F ( 23.1 °C ) in July . Official temperature extremes range from 105 °F ( 41 °C ) on July 24 , 1934 down to −21 °F ( −29 °C ) on January 21 , 1984 ; the record low maximum is −4 °F ( −20 °C ) on January 19 , 1994 , while , conversely the record high minimum is 80 °F ( 27 °C ) on August 1 , 2006 , the most recent of five occurrences . A decade or two may pass between readings of 100 °F ( 38 °C ) or higher , which last occurred July 17 , 2012 . The average window for freezing temperatures is October 20 thru April 22 , allowing a growing season of 180 days .
Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation , typically between hosts on a network . For instance , programs such as Carnivore and NarusInsight have been used by the FBI and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers . Even machines that operate as a closed system ( i.e. , with no contact to the outside world ) can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electro-magnetic transmissions generated by the hardware ; TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks .
The metal 's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers . The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion , thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering . It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts , depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain . Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished ' to embark a particular look , feel , and/or color . Finishes include mechanical surface treatments , chemical coloring , and coatings .
The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches , which had developed some different disciplines and practices , underwent its own process of codification , resulting in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches promulgated in 1990 by Pope John Paul II .
The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II , because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare . The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range , flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft . They had higher range and precision than naval guns , making them highly effective . The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto , signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes . This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers . World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets . The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers . Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about , as no other nation had fielded anything comparable . However , the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940 .
The 7th and 6th centuries BC witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads . Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta ( conclusion of the Vedas ) . The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual . Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death .
Carrying a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with old disks and demos to the studio and back , West crafted much of his production for his debut album in less than fifteen minutes at a time . He recorded the remainder of the album in Los Angeles while recovering from the car accident . Once he had completed the album , it was leaked months before its release date . However , West decided to use the opportunity to review the album , and The College Dropout was significantly remixed , remastered , and revised before being released . As a result , certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted , among them " Keep the Receipt " with Ol ' Dirty Bastard and " The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly " with Consequence . West meticulously refined the production , adding string arrangements , gospel choirs , improved drum programming and new verses . West 's perfectionism led The College Dropout to have its release postponed three times from its initial date in August 2003 .
The Ministry of Defence is one of the United Kingdom 's largest landowners , owning 227,300 hectares of land and foreshore ( either freehold or leasehold ) at April 2014 , which was valued at " about £20 billion " . The MoD also has " rights of access " to a further 222,000 hectares . In total , this is about 1.8 % of the UK land mass . The total annual cost to support the defence estate is " in excess of £3.3 billion " .
Residents of Norfolk Island do not pay Australian federal taxes , creating a tax haven for locals and visitors alike . Because there is no income tax , the island 's legislative assembly raises money through an import duty , fuel levy , medicare levy , GST of 12 % and local/international phone calls . In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island , David Buffett , announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts . The introduction of income taxation will now come into effect on July 1 , 2016 , with a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island 's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool so that the island can have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health , education , medicare , and infrastructure . Prior to these reforms residents of Norfolk Island were not entitled to social services . It appears that the reforms do extend to companies and trustees and not only individuals .
Between April 1877 and February 1878 , she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War , but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin . Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy , which Victoria endorsed , led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War . " If we are to maintain our position as a first-rate Power " , she wrote , " we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars , somewhere or other , CONTINUALLY . " Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign , protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers : " It is not in our custom to annexe countries " , she said , " unless we are obliged & forced to do so . " To Victoria 's dismay , Disraeli lost the 1880 general election , and Gladstone returned as prime minister . When Disraeli died the following year , she was blinded by " fast falling tears " , and erected a memorial tablet " placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend , Victoria R.I . "
In 1964 , Turkey tried to invade Cyprus in response to the continuing Cypriot intercommunal violence . But Turkey was stopped by a strongly worded telegram from the US President Lyndon B. Johnson on 5 June , warning that the US would not stand beside Turkey in case of a consequential Soviet invasion of Turkish territory . Meanwhile , by 1964 , enosis was a Greek policy that could not be abandoned ; Makarios and the Greek prime minister Georgios Papandreou agreed that enosis should be the ultimate aim and King Constantine wished Cyprus " a speedy union with the mother country " . Greece dispatched 10,000 troops to Cyprus to counter a possible Turkish invasion .
Other major employers in the city include Ordnance Survey , the UK 's national mapping agency , whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city , opened in February 2011 . The Lloyd 's Register Group has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton . The area of Swaythling is home to Ford 's Southampton Assembly Plant , where the majority of their Transit models are manufactured . Closure of the plant in 2013 was announced in 2012 , with the loss of hundreds of jobs .
In ordinary circumstances , transduction , conjugation , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens .
Madonna also began work on her thirteenth studio album , with collaborators including Avicii , Diplo and Natalia Kills . In December 2014 , thirteen demos recorded for the album leaked onto the Internet . She posted in response that half of the tracks would not be used on the final release , while the other half had " changed and evolved " . The album , titled Rebel Heart , was released on March 10 , 2015 . From September 2015 , she embarked on the Rebel Heart Tour to promote the album ; the tour ended in March 2016 and traveled throughout North America , Europe and Asia and was the singer 's first visit to Australia in 23 years , where she also performed a one-off show for her fans . It grossed a total of $ 169.8 million from the 82 shows , with over 1.045 million ticket sales . While on tour Madonna became embroiled in a legal battle with Ritchie , over the custody of her son Rocco . The dispute started when Rocco decided to continue living at England with Ritchie when the Rebel Heart Tour had visited there , while Madonna wanted him to return with her . Court hearings took place in both New York and London , and after multiple deliberations , Madonna decided to withdraw her application for custody , and appealed for a mutual discussion between herself and Ritchie about Rocco .
In the early Sumerian Uruk period , the primitive pictograms suggest that sheep , goats , cattle , and pigs were domesticated . They used oxen as their primary beasts of burden and donkeys or equids as their primary transport animal and " woollen clothing as well as rugs were made from the wool or hair of the animals . ... By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants ; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields , and the shaduf was already employed for the purpose of irrigation . Plants were also grown in pots or vases . "
International pressure led to a ceasefire , and by then 37 % of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north . At the same time , around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots . Among a variety of sanctions against Turkey , in mid-1975 the US Congress imposed an arms embargo on Turkey for using American-supplied equipment during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 . There are 1,534 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots missing as a result of the fighting .
Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot . When Atticus is out of town , Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach . This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church , which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life , as well as Tom Robinson 's . Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage , causing the audience to laugh uproariously . She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume , which saves her life .
More detail was given in Darwin 's 1868 book on The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication , which tried to explain heredity through his hypothesis of pangenesis . Although Darwin had privately questioned blending inheritance , he struggled with the theoretical difficulty that novel individual variations would tend to blend into a population . However , inherited variation could be seen , and Darwin 's concept of selection working on a population with a range of small variations was workable . It was not until the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s that a model of heredity became completely integrated with a model of variation . This modern evolutionary synthesis had been dubbed Neo Darwinian Evolution because it encompasses Charles Darwin 's theories of evolution with Gregor Mendel 's theories of genetic inheritance .
In 2003 the FA took the decision to permanently use the new Wembley for semi-finals to recoup debts in financing the new stadium . This was controversial , with the move seen as both unfair to fans of teams located far from London , as well as taking some of the prestige away from a Wembley final . In defending the move , the FA has also cited the extra capacity Wembley offers , although the 2013 fixture between Millwall and Wigan led to the unprecedented step of placing 6,000 tickets on sale to neutral fans after the game failed to sell out . A fan poll by The Guardian in 2013 found 86 % opposition to Wembley semi-finals .
Energy sources unsuitable for mobile power plants , such as nuclear power , renewable hydroelectricity , or wind power can be used . According to widely accepted global energy reserve statistics , the reserves of liquid fuel are much less than gas and coal ( at 42 , 167 and 416 years respectively ) . Most countries with large rail networks do not have significant oil reserves and those that did , like the United States and Britain , have exhausted much of their reserves and have suffered declining oil output for decades . Therefore , there is also a strong economic incentive to substitute other fuels for oil . Rail electrification is often considered an important route towards consumption pattern reform . However , there are no reliable , peer-reviewed studies available to assist in rational public debate on this critical issue , although there are untranslated Soviet studies from the 1980s .
In 1978 , Queen toured the US and Canada , and spent much of 1979 touring in Europe and Japan . They released their first live album , Live Killers , in 1979 ; it went platinum twice in the US . Queen also released the very successful single " Crazy Little Thing Called Love " , a rockabilly inspired song done in the style of Elvis Presley . The song made the top 10 in many countries , topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven consecutive weeks , and was the band 's first number one single in the United States where it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks . Having written the song on guitar and played rhythm on the record , Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live , which was the first time he ever played guitar in concert . In December 1979 , Queen played the opening night at the Concert for the People of Kampuchea in London , having accepted a request by the event 's organiser Paul McCartney .
Kuaiji Commandery was the initial power base for Xiang Liang and Xiang Yu 's rebellion against the Qin Empire which initially succeeded in restoring the kingdom of Chu but eventually fell to the Han . Under the Later Han , control of the area returned to the settlement below Mount Kuaiji but authority over the Minyue hinterland was nominal at best and its Yue inhabitants largely retained their own political and social structures .
Part of the Russian resistance was credited [ by whom ? ] to the deployment of newly invented blockade mines . Perhaps the most influential contributor to the development of naval mining was a Swede resident in Russia , the inventor and civil engineer Immanuel Nobel ( the father of Alfred Nobel ) . Immanuel Nobel helped the Russian war effort by applying his knowledge of industrial explosives , such as nitroglycerin and gunpowder . One account dates modern naval mining from the Crimean War : " Torpedo mines , if I may use this name given by Fulton to self-acting mines underwater , were among the novelties attempted by the Russians in their defences about Cronstadt and Sevastopol " , as one American officer put it in 1860 .
Late Carboniferous and Early Permian insect orders include both extant groups , their stem groups , and a number of Paleozoic groups , now extinct . During this era , some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm ( 22 to 28 in ) , making them far larger than any living insect . This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today . The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor . Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago . Many of the early groups became extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event , the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth , around 252 million years ago .
In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office .
During adolescence , the human body undergoes various physical , physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones , of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol ( an oestrogen ) and , in males , is testosterone . Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later . There is evidence that these steroids act directly not only on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system , including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity . There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system .
In 1954 , major Serbian and Croatian writers , linguists and literary critics , backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement , which in its first conclusion stated : " Serbs , Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb ( western ) and Belgrade ( eastern ) " . The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts , and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations . It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts , while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained . Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary , and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis . During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad . Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an act of unitarianism . The evidence supporting this claim is patchy : Croatian linguist Stjepan Babić complained that the television transmission from Belgrade always used the Latin alphabet— which was true , but was not proof of unequal rights , but of frequency of use and prestige . Babić further complained that the Novi Sad Dictionary ( 1967 ) listed side by side words from both the Croatian and Serbian variants wherever they differed , which one can view as proof of careful respect for both variants , and not of unitarism . Moreover , Croatian linguists criticized those parts of the Dictionary for being unitaristic that were written by Croatian linguists . And finally , Croatian linguists ignored the fact that the material for the Pravopisni rječnik came from the Croatian Philological Society . Regardless of these facts , Croatian intellectuals brought the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language in 1967 . On occasion of the publication ’ s 45th anniversary , the Croatian weekly journal Forum published the Declaration again in 2012 , accompanied by a critical analysis .
Miami has a tropical monsoon climate ( Köppen climate classification Am ) with hot and humid summers and short , warm winters , with a marked drier season in the winter . Its sea-level elevation , coastal location , position just above the Tropic of Cancer , and proximity to the Gulf Stream shapes its climate . With January averaging 67.2 °F ( 19.6 °C ) , winter features mild to warm temperatures ; cool air usually settles after the passage of a cold front , which produces much of the little amount of rainfall during the season . Lows occasionally fall below 50 °F ( 10 °C ) , but very rarely below 35 °F ( 2 °C ) . Highs generally range between 70–77 °F ( 21–25 °C ) .
In ancient India , literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted . Early genres included drama , fables , sutras and epic poetry . Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas , dating back to 1500–1000 BCE , and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India . The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts . The Samhitas ( vedic collections ) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE , and the " circum-Vedic " texts , as well as the redaction of the Samhitas , date to c. 1000-500 BCE , resulting in a Vedic period , spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE , or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age . The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BC saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics , the Mahabharata and the Ramayana , with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD .
On average , the mountains of the western states receive the highest levels of snowfall on Earth . The greatest annual snowfall level is at Mount Rainier in Washington , at 692 inches ( 1,758 cm ) ; the record there was 1,122 inches ( 2,850 cm ) in the winter of 1971–72 . This record was broken by the Mt . Baker Ski Area in northwestern Washington which reported 1,140 inches ( 2,896 cm ) of snowfall for the 1998-99 snowfall season . Other places with significant snowfall outside the Cascade Range are the Wasatch Mountains , near the Great Salt Lake , the San Juan Mountains in Colorado , and the Sierra Nevada , near Lake Tahoe .
Some powerful Polish nobles were referred to as " magnates " ( Polish singular : " magnat " , plural : " magnaci " ) and " możny " ( " magnate " , " oligarch " ; plural : " możni " ) ; see Magnates of Poland and Lithuania .
Islanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk , a blend of 18th-century English and Tahitian . The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons ; however , there are efforts to keep it alive via dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents . In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island . The act is long-titled : " An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language ( Norf'k ) as an official language of Norfolk Island . " The " language known as 'Norf'k ' " is described as the language " that is spoken by descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island " . The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it ; in official use , it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English . 32 % of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census , and just under three-quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk .
There are several other important art museums in Montevideo . The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rodó has Uruguay 's largest collection of paintings . The Juan Manuel Blanes Museum was founded in 1930 , the 100th anniversary of the first Constitution of Uruguay , significant with regard to the fact that Juan Manuel Blanes painted Uruguayan patriotic themes . In back of the museum is a beautiful Japanese Garden with a pond where there are over a hundred carp . The Museo de Historia del Arte , located in the Palacio Municipal , features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt , Mesopotamia , Persia , Greece , Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period . The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial , in the Ciudad Vieja , has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei . These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America , painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico , Peru and Brazil . The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture .
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of R & D units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the INETI – Instituto Nacional de Engenharia , Tecnologia e Inovação and the INRB – Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biológicos . The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science , Technology and Higher Education ( MCTES ) itself and the MCTES 's Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia ( FCT ) . The largest R & D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications , include biosciences research institutions like the Instituto de Medicina Molecular , the Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology , the IPATIMUP , the Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular and the Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute .
Originally known as Buckingham House , the building at the core of today 's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 on a site that had been in private ownership for at least 150 years . It was acquired by King George III in 1761 as a private residence for Queen Charlotte and became known as " The Queen 's House " . During the 19th century it was enlarged , principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore , who constructed three wings around a central courtyard . Buckingham Palace became the London residence of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 .
After the Partisans managed to endure and avoid these intense Axis attacks between January and June 1943 , and the extent of Chetnik collaboration became evident , Allied leaders switched their support from Draža Mihailović to Tito . King Peter II , American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill joined Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin in officially recognising Tito and the Partisans at the Tehran Conference . This resulted in Allied aid being parachuted behind Axis lines to assist the Partisans . On 17 June 1944 on the Dalmatian island of Vis , the Treaty of Vis ( Viški sporazum ) was signed in an attempt to merge Tito 's government ( the AVNOJ ) with the government in exile of King Peter II . The Balkan Air Force was formed in June 1944 to control operations that were mainly aimed at aiding his forces .
Colossus was the world 's first electronic digital programmable computer . It used a large number of valves ( vacuum tubes ) . It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data , but it was not Turing-complete . Nine Mk II Colossi were built ( The Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total ) . Colossus Mark I contained 1500 thermionic valves ( tubes ) , but Mark II with 2400 valves , was both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1 , greatly speeding the decoding process .
On March 10 , 2004 , Bush officially clinched the number of delegates needed to be nominated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City . Bush accepted the nomination on September 2 , 2004 , and selected Vice President Dick Cheney as his running mate . ( In New York , the ticket was also on the ballot as candidates of the Conservative Party of New York State . ) During the convention and throughout the campaign , Bush focused on two themes : defending America against terrorism and building an ownership society . The ownership society included allowing people to invest some of their Social Security in the stock market , increasing home and stock ownership , and encouraging more people to buy their own health insurance .
The FBI is near-impenetrable , with applicants intensely scrutinized and assessed over an extended period . To apply to become an FBI agent , one must be between the ages of 23 and 37 . Due to the decision in Robert P. Isabella v. Department of State and Office of Personnel Management , 2008 M.S.P.B . 146 , preference-eligible veterans may apply after age 37 . In 2009 , the Office of Personnel Management issued implementation guidance on the Isabella decision . The applicant must also hold American citizenship , be of high moral character , have a clean record , and hold at least a four-year bachelor 's degree . At least three years of professional work experience prior to application is also required . All FBI employees require a Top Secret ( TS ) security clearance , and in many instances , employees need a TS/SCI ( Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information ) clearance . To obtain a security clearance , all potential FBI personnel must pass a series of Single Scope Background Investigations ( SSBI ) , which are conducted by the Office of Personnel Management . Special Agents candidates also have to pass a Physical Fitness Test ( PFT ) , which includes a 300-meter run , one-minute sit-ups , maximum push-ups , and a 1.5-mile ( 2.4 km ) run . Personnel must pass a polygraph test with questions including possible drug use . Applicants who fail polygraphs may not gain employment with the FBI .
There is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed , and that racial groups can not be biologically defined . Nonetheless , some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits ( e.g . phenotype ) to some degree , and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations , some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings . For this reason , there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation .
In 1837 , the personal union of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because William IV 's heir in the United Kingdom was female ( Queen Victoria ) . Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs . Thus , Hanover passed to William IV 's brother , Ernest Augustus , and remained a kingdom until 1866 , when it was annexed by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian war . Despite being expected to defeat Prussia at the Battle of Langensalza , Prussia employed Moltke the Elder 's Kesselschlacht order of battle to instead destroy the Hanoverian army . The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian Province of Hanover . After the annexation , the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government .

Starting in 1910 , the army began acquiring fixed-wing aircraft . In 1910 , Mexico was having a civil war , peasant rebels fighting government soldiers . The army was deployed to American towns near the border to ensure safety to lives and property . In 1916 , Pancho Villa , a major rebel leader , attacked Columbus , New Mexico , prompting a U.S. intervention in Mexico until 7 February 1917 . They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918 . The United States joined World War I in 1917 on the side of Britain , France , Russia , Italy and other allies . U.S. troops were sent to the Western Front and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war . With the armistice in November 1918 , the army once again decreased its forces .
The Emperor Diocletian ( r. 284–305 ) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286 ; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers , as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other . [ C ] In 330 , after a period of civil war , Constantine the Great ( r. 306–337 ) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital , Constantinople . Diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy , reformed taxation , and strengthened the army , which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation , a declining birthrate , and pressures on its frontiers , among others . Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century , diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach . For much of the 4th century , Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between the rich and poor , and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns . Another change was the Christianisation , or conversion of the empire to Christianity , a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries .
Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen ( binder ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 % added asphalt/bitumen . This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C ( 410 °F ) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters ( 0.79 inches ) thick .
The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication , which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome . The resulting genes ( paralogs ) may then diverge in sequence and in function . Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family . Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity . Sometimes , gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene , or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function ; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes . :7.6
Plymouth is home to Plymouth Argyle F.C. , who play in the fourth tier of English football league known as Football League Two . The team 's home ground is called Home Park and is located in Central Park .

St. John 's is the eastern terminus of the Trans-Canada Highway , one of the longest national highways in the world . The divided highway , also known as " Outer Ring Road " in the city , runs just outside the main part of the city , with exits to Pitts Memorial Drive , Topsail Road , Team Gushue Highway , Thorburn Road , Allandale Road , Portugal Cove Road and Torbay Road , providing relatively easy access to neighbourhoods served by those streets . Pitts Memorial Drive runs from Conception Bay South , through the city of Mount Pearl and into downtown St. John 's , with interchanges for Goulds , Water Street and Hamilton Avenue-New Gower Street .
Maternal factors also play a role in the body ’ s immune response . At birth , most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG . Because IgM , IgD , IgE and IgA don ’ t cross the placenta , they are almost undetectable at birth . Some IgA is provided by breast milk . These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months , but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity . These antibodies can also produce a negative response . If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response . Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization . Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults , and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates . Between six to nine months after birth , a child ’ s immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins , but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old . This can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules .
Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona 's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça 's revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia 's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists .
Increasingly , more modern games such as video games and slot machines are provided . Pubs hold special events , from tournaments of the aforementioned games to karaoke nights to pub quizzes . Some play pop music and hip-hop ( dance bar ) , or show football and rugby union on big screen televisions ( sports bar ) . Shove ha'penny and Bat and trap were also popular in pubs south of London .
In August 2008 , West revealed plans to open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area ; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park . The second followed in January 2009 , while a third location is yet to be revealed , although the process is being finalized . His company , KW Foods LLC , bought the rights to the chain in Chicago . Ultimately , in 2009 , only two locations actually opened . In February 2011 , West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park . Later that year , the remaining Beverly location also was shuttered .

To aid customers with defective consoles , Microsoft extended the Xbox 360 's manufacturer 's warranty to three years for hardware failure problems that generate a " General Hardware Failure " error report . A " General Hardware Failure " is recognized on all models released before the Xbox 360 S by three quadrants of the ring around the power button flashing red . This error is often known as the " Red Ring of Death " . In April 2009 the warranty was extended to also cover failures related to the E74 error code . The warranty extension is not granted for any other types of failures that do not generate these specific error codes .
The formal structure of the Qing government centered on the Emperor as the absolute ruler , who presided over six Boards ( Ministries [ c ] ) , each headed by two presidents [ d ] and assisted by four vice presidents . [ e ] In contrast to the Ming system , however , Qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations . The Grand Secretariat , [ f ] which had been an important policy-making body under the Ming , lost its importance during the Qing and evolved into an imperial chancery . The institutions which had been inherited from the Ming formed the core of the Qing " Outer Court , " which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the Forbidden City .
Mary is also depicted as being present among the women at the crucifixion during the crucifixion standing near " the disciple whom Jesus loved " along with Mary of Clopas and Mary Magdalene , [ Jn 19:25-26 ] to which list Matthew 27:56 adds " the mother of the sons of Zebedee " , presumably the Salome mentioned in Mark 15:40 . This representation is called a Stabat Mater . While not recorded in the Gospel accounts , Mary cradling the dead body of her son is a common motif in art , called a " pietà " or " pity " .
The Oak Street Connector ( Connecticut Route 34 ) intersects I-91 at exit 1 , just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange , and runs northwest for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto surface roads . The Wilbur Cross Parkway ( Connecticut Route 15 ) runs parallel to I-95 west of New Haven , turning northwards as it nears the city and then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven and Hamden , offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey ( restricted to non-commercial vehicles ) . Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only highway tunnel in the state ( officially designated as Heroes Tunnel ) , running through West Rock , home to West Rock Park and the Three Judges Cave .
Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences , singers and conductors , when a work is being sung in a language not known to them . The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances , those inserted into concert programs , and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music . In addition , professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know ( or do not know well ) , and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing .
The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold ; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition , an unsusually large proportion of the populations ( 5 % is often cited ) regularly sing in choirs , the Swedish choral director Eric Ericson had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world , and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools ( music schools ) with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day , a system that started with Adolf Fredrik 's Music School in Stockholm in 1939 but has spread over the country .
In March 2013 Mendes said he would not return to direct the next film in the series , then known as Bond 24 ; he later recanted and announced that he would return , as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing . In directing Skyfall and Spectre , Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989 . Skyfall writer John Logan resumed his role of scriptwriter , collaborating with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade , who returned for their sixth Bond film . [ N 4 ] The writer Jez Butterworth also worked on the script , alongside Mendes and Craig . Dennis Gassner returned as the film 's production designer , while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins . In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of Spectre numbered over one thousand , making it a larger production than Skyfall . Craig is listed as co-producer .
British imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph , new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century , allowing it to control and defend the Empire . By 1902 , the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables , the so-called All Red Line . Growing until 1922 , around 13,000,000 square miles ( 34,000,000 km2 ) of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire . The British established colonies in Australia in 1788 , New Zealand in 1840 and Fiji in 1872 , with much of Oceania becoming part of the British Empire .
From January 18–20 , 2010 a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan , Yunnan , Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced . The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao , Wu Bangguo , Wen Jiabao , Jia Qinglin , Li Changchun , Xi Jinping , Li Keqiang , He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang , all members of CPC Politburo Standing Committee signaling the commitment of senior Chinese leaders to development of Tibet and ethnic Tibetan areas . The plan calls for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children . China has invested 310 billion yuan ( about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars ) in Tibet since 2001 . " Tibet 's GDP was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009 , up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years . "
On 14 June 1925 , in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera 's dictatorship , the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March . As a reprisal , the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club . This coincided with the transition to professional football , and , in 1926 , the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed , for the first time , to operate a professional football club . On 3 July 1927 , the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara , against the Spanish national team . To kick off the match , local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane . In 1928 , victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled " Oda a Platko " , which was written by a member of the Generation of '27 , Rafael Alberti , inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper , Franz Platko . On 23 June 1929 , Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League . A year after winning the championship , on 30 July 1930 , Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems .
Most of the state has a humid subtropical climate , with the exception of some of the higher elevations in the Appalachians , which are classified as having a mountain temperate climate or a humid continental climate due to cooler temperatures . The Gulf of Mexico is the dominant factor in the climate of Tennessee , with winds from the south being responsible for most of the state 's annual precipitation . Generally , the state has hot summers and mild to cool winters with generous precipitation throughout the year , with highest average monthly precipitation generally in the winter and spring months , between December and April . The driest months , on average , are August to October . On average the state receives 50 inches ( 130 cm ) of precipitation annually . Snowfall ranges from 5 inches ( 13 cm ) in West Tennessee to over 16 inches ( 41 cm ) in the higher mountains in East Tennessee .
During the campaign for the United Kingdom general election , 2010 , The Independent ran ads declaring that " Rupert Murdoch wo n't decide this election – you will . " In response James Murdoch and Rebekah Wade " appeared unannounced and uninvited on the editorial floor " of the Independent , and had an energetic conversation with its editor Simon Kelner . Several days later the Independent reported The Sun 's failure to report its own YouGov poll result which said that " if people thought Mr Clegg 's party had a significant chance of winning the election " the Liberal Democrats would win 49 % of the vote , and with it a landslide majority .
Unlike previous versions of Windows , Windows 8 was distributed at retail in " Upgrade " licenses only , which require an existing version of Windows to install . The " full version software " SKU , which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all , was discontinued . In lieu of full version , a specialized " System Builder " SKU was introduced . The " System Builder " SKU replaced the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) SKU , which was only allowed to be used on PCs meant for resale , but added a " Personal Use License " exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers .
In 1935 , Reza Shah requested the international community to refer to the country by its native name , Iran . As the New York Times explained at the time , " At the suggestion of the Persian Legation in Berlin , the Tehran government , on the Persian New Year , Nowruz , March 21 , 1935 , substituted Iran for Persia as the official name of the country . " Opposition to the name change led to the reversal of the decision , and Professor Ehsan Yarshater , editor of Encyclopædia Iranica , propagated a move to use Persia and Iran interchangeably . Today , both Persia and Iran are used in cultural contexts ; although , Iran is the name used officially in political contexts .
Another study on men and women 's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal , independent of their sexual orientations . The study found that women 's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex ( heterosexual and homosexual ) and from videos showing non-human primates ( bonobos ) having sex . Men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli , their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest ( women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men ) .
Evidence suggests that blast furnaces , that convert raw iron ore into pig iron , which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast , were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period ( 722–481 BC ) . The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China ; however , the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization . Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process .
Of the city 's population over the age of 25 , 53.8 % ( vs. a national average of 27.4 % ) hold a bachelor 's degree or higher , and 91.9 % ( vs. 84.5 % nationally ) have a high school diploma or equivalent . A 2008 United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U.S. city . The city was listed as the most literate of the country 's 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006 , the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University .
There is an extensive network of caves , including Wookey Hole , underground rivers , and gorges , including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge . The county has many rivers , including the Axe , Brue , Cary , Parrett , Sheppey , Tone and Yeo . These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of mid and west Somerset . In the north of the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon . The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport , where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs . At the same site during the reign of King Charles I , river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge .
In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend suspects , the United States FBI employs the term " race " to summarize the general appearance ( skin color , hair texture , eye shape , and other such easily noticed characteristics ) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend . From the perspective of law enforcement officers , it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by DNA or other such means . Thus , in addition to assigning a wanted individual to a racial category , such a description will include : height , weight , eye color , scars and other distinguishing characteristics .
On 15 September the Luftwaffe made two large daylight attacks on London along the Thames Estuary , targeting the docks and rail communications in the city . Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them , allowing the Luftwaffe to destroy their fighters in large numbers , thereby achieving an air superiority . Large air battles broke out , lasting for most of the day . The first attack merely damaged the rail network for three days , and the second attack failed altogether . The air battle was later commemorated by Battle of Britain Day . The Luftwaffe lost 18 percent of the bombers sent on the operations that day , and failed to gain air superiority .
The largest plaza in Valencia is the Plaza del Ayuntamiento ; it is home to the City Hall ( Ayuntamiento ) on its western side and the central post office ( Edificio de Correos ) on its eastern side , a cinema that shows classic movies , and many restaurants and bars . The plaza is triangular in shape , with a large cement lot at the southern end , normally surrounded by flower vendors . It serves as ground zero during the Les Falles when the fireworks of the Mascletà can be heard every afternoon . There is a large fountain at the northern end .
During the Cantonal Revolution of 1873 , a cantonalist uprising that took place during the First Spanish Republic , the city was consolidated with most of the nearby cities in the Federal Canton of Valencia ( proclaimed on 19 July and dissolved on 7 August ) . It did not have the revolutionary fervor of the movement in cities like Alcoy , as it was initiated by the bourgeoisie , but the Madrid government sent General Martinez-Campos to stifle the rebellion by force of arms and subjected Valencia to an intense bombardment . The city surrendered on 7 August ; Alfonso XII was proclaimed king on 29 December 1874 , and arrived in Valencia on 11 January 1875 on his way to Madrid , marking the end of the first republic . Despite the Bourbon restoration , the roughly even balance between conservatives and liberals in the government was sustained in Valencia until the granting of universal male suffrage in 1890 , after which the Republicans , led by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez , gained considerably more of the popular vote .
With a population of 518,000 , Hanover is a major centre of Northern Germany and the country 's thirteenth largest city . Hanover also hosts annual commercial trade fairs such as the Hanover Fair and the CeBIT . Every year Hanover hosts the Schützenfest Hannover , the world 's largest marksmen 's festival , and the Oktoberfest Hannover , the second largest Oktoberfest in the world ( beside Oktoberfest of Blumenau ) . In 2000 , Hanover hosted the world fair Expo 2000 . The Hanover fairground , due to numerous extensions , especially for the Expo 2000 , is the largest in the world . Hanover is of national importance because of its universities and medical school , its international airport and its large zoo . The city is also a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ( Autobahnen ) , connecting European main lines in both the east-west ( Berlin–Ruhr area ) and north-south ( Hamburg–Munich , etc . ) directions .
A commandery consisted of a group of counties , and was headed by an Administrator . He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense , lawsuits , seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu . The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect , while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs , and both could be referred to as Magistrates . A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county , registered the populace for taxation , mobilized commoners for annual corvée duties , repaired schools and supervised public works .
Catalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language ( see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages ) . Thus , as it should be expected from closely related languages , Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages .
The foundation has donated billions of dollars to help sufferers of AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , protecting millions of children from death at the hands of preventable diseases . However , a 2007 investigation by The Los Angeles Times claimed there are three major unintended consequences with the foundation 's allocation of aid . First , sub-Saharan Africa already suffered from a shortage of primary doctors before the arrival of the Gates Foundation , but " by pouring most contributions into the fight against such high-profile killers as AIDS , Gates grantees have increased the demand for specially trained , higher-paid clinicians , diverting staff from basic care " in sub-Saharan Africa . This " brain drain " adds to the existing doctor shortage and pulls away additional trained staff from children and those suffering from other common killers . Second , " the focus on a few diseases has shortchanged basic needs such as nutrition and transportation " . Third , " Gates-funded vaccination programs have instructed caregivers to ignore – even discourage patients from discussing – ailments that the vaccinations can not prevent " .
155th Street starts on the West Side at Riverside Drive , crossing Broadway , Amsterdam Avenue and St. Nicholas Avenue . At St. Nicholas Place , the terrain drops off steeply , and 155th Street is carried on a 1,600-foot ( 490 m ) long viaduct , a City Landmark constructed in 1893 , that slopes down towards the Harlem River , continuing onto the Macombs Dam Bridge , crossing over ( but not intersecting with ) the Harlem River Drive . A separate , unconnected section of 155th Street runs under the viaduct , connecting Bradhurst Avenue and the Harlem River Drive .
The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad . Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars , with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801 . Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens . During the Revolution , the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794 . Under the terms of Amiens , however , Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented . The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane , even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places . The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies , not slavery itself . Napoleon sent an expedition under General Leclerc designed to reassert control over Sainte-Domingue . Although the French managed to capture Toussaint Louverture , the expedition failed when high rates of disease crippled the French army . In May 1803 , the last 8000 French troops left the island and the slaves proclaimed an independent republic that they called Haïti in 1804 . Seeing the failure of his colonial efforts , Napoleon decided in 1803 to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States , instantly doubling the size of the U.S . The selling price in the Louisiana Purchase was less than three cents per acre , a total of $ 15 million .
Some early male settlers married Indigenous American women and had informal unions with them . Early contact between Indigenous Americans and Europeans was often charged with tension , but also had moments of friendship , cooperation , and intimacy . Marriages took place in both English and Latin colonies between European men and Native women . For instance , on April 5 , 1614 , Pocahontas , a Powhatan woman in present-day Virginia , married the Englishman John Rolfe of Jamestown . Their son Thomas Rolfe was an ancestor to many descendants in First Families of Virginia . As a result , English laws did not exclude people with some Indigenous American ancestry from being considered English or white .
The modern spelling , Tennessee , is attributed to James Glen , the governor of South Carolina , who used this spelling in his official correspondence during the 1750s . The spelling was popularized by the publication of Henry Timberlake 's " Draught of the Cherokee Country " in 1765 . In 1788 , North Carolina created " Tennessee County " , the third county to be established in what is now Middle Tennessee . ( Tennessee County was the predecessor to current-day Montgomery County and Robertson County . ) When a constitutional convention met in 1796 to organize a new state out of the Southwest Territory , it adopted " Tennessee " as the name of the state .
On May 21 , 2014 , JPMorgan Chase announced that it was injecting $ 100 million over five years into Detroit 's economy , providing development funding for a variety of projects that would increase employment . It is the largest commitment made to any one city by the nation 's biggest bank . [ citation needed ] Of the $ 100 million , $ 50 million will go toward development projects , $ 25 million will go toward city blight removal , $ 12.5 million will go for job training , $ 7 million will go for small businesses in the city , and $ 5.5 million will go toward the M-1 light rail project . On May 19 , 2015 , JPMorgan Chase announced that it has invested $ 32 million for two redevelopment projects in the city 's Capitol Park district , the Capitol Park Lofts ( the former Capitol Park Building ) and the Detroit Savings Bank building at 1212 Griswold . Those investments are separate from Chase 's five-year , $ 100-million commitment .
Thomas J. Watson , Sr. , fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson , called on Flint and , in 1914 , was offered CTR . Watson joined CTR as General Manager then , 11 months later , was made President when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved . Having learned Patterson 's pioneering business practices , Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR 's companies . He implemented sales conventions , " generous sales incentives , a focus on customer service , an insistence on well-groomed , dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker " . His favorite slogan , " THINK " , became a mantra for each company 's employees . During Watson 's first four years , revenues more than doubled to $ 9 million and the company 's operations expanded to Europe , South America , Asia and Australia . " Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR " and chose to replace it with the more expansive title " International Business Machines " . First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary , then as a line in advertisements . For example , the McClures magazine , v53 , May 1921 , has a full page ad with , at the bottom :
Pain is usually transitory , lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed , but some painful conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , peripheral neuropathy , cancer and idiopathic pain , may persist for years . Pain that lasts a long time is called chronic or persistent , and pain that resolves quickly is called acute . Traditionally , the distinction between acute and chronic pain has relied upon an arbitrary interval of time from onset ; the two most commonly used markers being 3 months and 6 months since the onset of pain , though some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months . :93 Others apply acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days , chronic to pain of more than six months ' duration , and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months . A popular alternative definition of chronic pain , involving no arbitrarily fixed durations , is " pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing " . Chronic pain may be classified as cancer pain or else as benign .
This time they succeeded , and on 31 December 1600 , the Queen granted a Royal Charter to " George , Earl of Cumberland , and 215 Knights , Aldermen , and Burgesses " under the name , Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies . For a period of fifteen years the charter awarded the newly formed company a monopoly on trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan . Sir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601 and returned in 1603. and in March 1604 Sir Henry Middleton commanded the second voyage . General William Keeling , a captain during the second voyage , led the third voyage from 1607 to 1610 .
In 712 , Arab Muslim general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region in modern-day Pakistan for the Umayyad Empire , incorporating it as the " As-Sindh " province with its capital at Al-Mansurah , 72 km ( 45 mi ) north of modern Hyderabad in Sindh , Pakistan . After several incursions , the Hindu kings east of Indus defeated the Arabs at the Battle of Rajasthan , halting their expansion and containing them at Sindh in Pakistan . The south Indian Chalukya empire under Vikramaditya II , Nagabhata I of the Pratihara dynasty and Bappa Rawal of the Guhilot dynasty repulsed the Arab invaders in the early 8th century .
In a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria . It is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the ABC protein , membrane fusion protein ( MFP ) , and outer membrane protein ( OMP ) [ specify ] . This secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20 - 900 kDa ) . The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V , ( 10 kDa ) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa .
A Japanese force was sent north to attack the Aleutian Islands . The next stage of the plan called for the capture of Midway , which would give him an opportunity to destroy Nimitz 's remaining carriers . In May , Allied codebreakers discovered his intentions . Nagumo was again in tactical command but was focused on the invasion of Midway ; Yamamoto 's complex plan had no provision for intervention by Nimitz before the Japanese expected him . Planned surveillance of the U.S. fleet by long range seaplane did not happen ( as a result of an abortive identical operation in March ) , so Fletcher 's carriers were able to proceed to a flanking position without being detected . Nagumo had 272 planes operating from his four carriers , the U.S. 348 ( 115 land-based ) .
While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France , it also has some of the poorest , mostly on the eastern side of the city . In 2012 , 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month , the official poverty line . Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line ; 24 percent in the 18th , 22 percent in the 20th and 18 percent in the 10th . In the city 's wealthiest neighbourhood , the 7th arrondissement , 7 percent lived below the poverty line ; 8 percent in the 6th arrondissement ; and 9 percent in the 16th arrondissement .
As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman , the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence . Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class , courage , compassion , and gender roles in the American Deep South . The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice . Despite its themes , To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms , often challenged for its use of racial epithets .
British post-punk entered the 1980s with support from members of the critical community—American critic Greil Marcus characterised " Britain 's postpunk pop avant-garde " in a 1980 Rolling Stone article as " sparked by a tension , humour and sense of paradox plainly unique in present day pop music " —as well as media figures such as BBC DJ John Peel , while several groups , such as PiL and Joy Division , achieved some success in the popular charts . The network of supportive record labels that included Industrial , Fast , E.G. , Mute , Axis/4AD and Glass continued to facilitate a large output of music , by artists such as the Raincoats , Essential Logic , Killing Joke , the Teardrop Explodes , and the Psychedelic Furs .
Alexander Bell was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , on March 3 , 1847 . The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street , and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell 's birthplace . He had two brothers : Melville James Bell ( 1845–70 ) and Edward Charles Bell ( 1848–67 ) , both of whom would die of tuberculosis . His father was Professor Alexander Melville Bell , a phonetician , and his mother was Eliza Grace ( née Symonds ) . Born as just " Alexander Bell " , at age 10 he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers . [ N 6 ] For his 11th birthday , his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name " Graham " , chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham , a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend . To close relatives and friends he remained " Aleck " .
A wrestling match may be declared a no contest if the winning conditions are unable to occur . This can be due to excessive interference , loss of referee 's control over the match , one or more participants sustaining debilitating injury not caused by the opponent , or the inability of a scheduled match to even begin . A no contest is a state separate and distinct from a draw — a draw indicates winning conditions were met . Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in practice , this usage is technically incorrect .
On September 10 , 1987 , after a lecture from hardliner Yegor Ligachev at the Politburo for allowing these two unsanctioned demonstrations in Moscow , Boris Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev , who had been holidaying on the Black Sea . Gorbachev was stunned – no one had ever voluntarily resigned from the Politburo . At the October 27 , 1987 , plenary meeting of the Central Committee , Yeltsin , frustrated that Gorbachev had not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter , criticized the slow pace of reform , servility to the general secretary , and opposition from Ligachev that had led to his ( Yeltsin 's ) resignation . No one had ever addressed the Party leader so brazenly in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s . In his reply , Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of " political immaturity " and " absolute irresponsibility . " No one backed Yeltsin .
Street parking in urban neighborhoods is mostly controlled by the franeleros a.k.a . " viene vienes " ( lit . " come on , come on " ) , who ask drivers for a fee to park , in theory to guard the car , but with the implicit threat that the franelero will damage the car if the fee is not paid . Double parking is common ( with franeleros moving the cars as required ) , impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass . In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue , 721 parking meters ( as of October 2013 ) , have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods Lomas de Chapultepec , Condesa , Roma , Polanco and Anzures , in operation from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes , with offenders ' cars booted , costing about 500 pesos to remove . 30 percent of the monthly 16 million-peso ( as of October 2013 ) income from the parking-meter system ( named " ecoParq " ) is earmarked for neighborhood improvements . The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters , Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario , has generated controversy .
Sheldon Pollock argues that " most observers would agree that , in some crucial way , Sanskrit is dead " . :393 Pollock has further argued that , while Sanskrit continued to be used in literary cultures in India , it was never adapted to express the changing forms of subjectivity and sociality as embodied and conceptualised in the modern age . :416 Instead , it was reduced to " reinscription and restatements " of ideas already explored , and any creativity was restricted to hymns and verses . :398 A notable exception are the military references of Nīlakaṇṭha Caturdhara 's 17th-century commentary on the Mahābhārata .
On 24 August , Pravda and Izvestia carried news of the non-secret portions of the Pact , complete with the now infamous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty , with a smiling Stalin looking on . The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide , most of whom were aware only of the British–French–Soviet negotiations that had taken place for months . The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was received with shock by Nazi Germany 's allies , notably Japan , by the Comintern and foreign communist parties , and by Jewish communities all around the world . So , that day , German diplomat Hans von Herwarth , whose grandmother was Jewish , informed Guido Relli , an Italian diplomat , and American chargé d'affaires Charles Bohlen on the secret protocol regarding vital interests in the countries ' allotted " spheres of influence " , without revealing the annexation rights for " territorial and political rearrangement " .
Malaysia-based Yazhou Zhoukan conducted an interview with former researcher at the China Seismological Bureau Geng Qingguo ( 耿庆国 ) , in which Geng claimed that a confidential written report was sent to the State Seismological Bureau on April 30 , 2008 , warning about the possible occurrence of a significant earthquake in Ngawa Prefecture region of Sichuan around May 8 , with a range of 10 days before or after the quake . Geng , while acknowledging that earthquake prediction was broadly considered problematic by the scientific community , believed that " the bigger the earthquake , the easier it is to predict . " Geng had long attempted to establish a correlation between the occurrence of droughts and earthquakes ; Premier Zhou Enlai reportedly took an interest in Geng 's work . Geng 's drought-earthquake correlation theory was first released in 1972 , and said to have successfully predicted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes . The same Yazhou Zhoukan article pointed out the inherent difficulties associated with predicting earthquakes . In response , an official with the Seismological Bureau stated that " earthquake prediction is widely acknowledged around the world to be difficult from a scientific standpoint . " The official also denied that the Seismological Bureau had received reports predicting the earthquake .
The 2013 Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Program was released on March 14 , 2013 , and calculates HDI values based on estimates for 2012 . Below is the list of the " very high human development " countries :
Gag and editorial cartoons usually consist of a single panel , often incorporating a caption or speech balloon . Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag , editorial , and other single-panel cartoons ; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image . Gag cartoons first began to proliferate in broadsheets published in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries , and the term " cartoon " [ h ] was first used to describe them in 1843 in the British humour magazine Punch .
Over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit . Sudharma , a daily newspaper in Sanskrit , has been published out of Mysore , India , since 1970 , while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years . Since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio . These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR 's website . Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST .
The placing of the nails in the hands , or the wrists is also uncertain . Some theories suggest that the Greek word cheir ( χειρ ) for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through Destot 's space ( between the capitate and lunate bones ) without fracturing any bones . Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm . Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails .
The development of writing is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures . Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world , the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE . What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block . The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE , around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane .
Intercommunal violence erupted on December 21 , 1963 , when two Turkish Cypriots were killed at an incident involving the Greek Cypriot police . The violence resulted in the death of 364 Turkish and 174 Greek Cypriots , destruction of 109 Turkish Cypriot or mixed villages and displacement of 25,000-30,000 Turkish Cypriots . The crisis resulted in the end of the Turkish Cypriot involvement in the administration and their claiming that it had lost its legitimacy ; the nature of this event is still controversial . In some areas , Greek Cypriots prevented Turkish Cypriots from travelling and entering government buildings , while some Turkish Cypriots willingly withdrew due to the calls of the Turkish Cypriot administration . Turkish Cypriots started living in enclaves ; the republic 's structure was changed unilaterally by Makarios and Nicosia was divided by the Green Line , with the deployment of UNFICYP troops .
Possibly in part due to expedited federal habeas corpus procedures embodied in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , the pace of executions picked up , reaching a peak of 98 in 1999 and then they declined gradually to 28 in 2015 . Since the death penalty was reauthorized in 1976 , 1,411 people have been executed , almost exclusively by the states , with most occurring after 1990 . Texas has accounted for over one-third of modern executions ( although only two death sentences were imposed in Texas during 2015 , with the courts preferring to issue sentences of life without parole instead ) and over four times as many as Oklahoma , the state with the second-highest number . California has the greatest number of prisoners on death row , has issued the highest number of death sentences but has held relatively few executions .
Dutch belongs to its own West Germanic sub-group , West Low Franconian , paired with its sister language Limburgish , or East Low Franconian . Closest relative is the mutual intelligible daughter language Afrikaans . Other West Germanic languages related to Dutch are German , English and the Frisian languages , and the non standardised languages Low German and Yiddish . Dutch stands out in combining a small degree of Ingvaeonic characteristics ( occurring consistently in English and Frisian and reduced in intensity from 'west to east ' over the continental West Germanic plane ) with mostly Istvaeonic characteristics , of which some of them are also incorporated in German . Unlike German , Dutch ( apart from Limburgish ) has not been influenced at all by the 'south to north ' movement of the High German sound shift , and had some changes of its own . The cumulation of these changes resulted over time in separate , but related standard languages with various degrees of similarities and differences between them . For a comparison between the West Germanic languages , see the sections Morphology , Grammar and Vocabulary .
Prior to the 12th century , women accounted for less than one percent of the world ’ s Islamic scholars . However , al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century . al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ to female scholars , giving information on 1,075 of them . More recently , the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi , currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies , has written 40 volumes on the muḥaddithāt ( the women scholars of ḥadīth ) , and found at least 8,000 of them .
Typically , the warmest day of the year ( 1971–2000 ) will achieve a temperature of 26.6 °C ( 80 °F ) , although in June 1976 the temperature reached 31.6 °C ( 89 °F ) , the site record . On average , 4.25 days of the year will report a maximum temperature of 25.1 °C ( 77 °F ) or above . During the winter half of the year , the coldest night will typically fall to −4.1 °C ( 25 °F ) although in January 1979 the temperature fell to −8.8 °C ( 16 °F ) . Typically , 18.6 nights of the year will register an air frost .
The internal working language of the ECB is generally English , and press conferences are usually held in English . External communications are handled flexibly : English is preferred ( though not exclusively ) for communication within the ESCB ( i.e . with other central banks ) and with financial markets ; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language , but the ECB website is predominantly English ; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU .
The Hebrew Bible , a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews , established the first of the Abrahamic religions , which are now practiced by 54 % of the world . Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief , and has been called not only a religion , but also a " way of life , " which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism , Jewish culture , and Jewish identity rather difficult . Throughout history , in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world , in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment ( see Haskalah ) , in Islamic Spain and Portugal , in North Africa and the Middle East , India , China , or the contemporary United States and Israel , cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious . Some factors in this come from within Judaism , others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings , others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community , as opposed to from the religion itself . This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities , each as authentically Jewish as the next .
The radish is also a typical food representing people of Nanjing , which has been spread through word of mouth as an interesting fact for many years in China . According to Nanjing.GOV.cn , " There is a long history of growing radish in Nanjing especially the southern suburb . In the spring , the radish tastes very juicy and sweet . It is well-known that people in Nanjing like eating radish . And the people are even addressed as 'Nanjing big radish ' , which means they are unsophisticated , passionate and conservative . From health perspective , eating radish can help to offset the stodgy food that people take during the Spring Festival " .
The hagiography of Mary and the Holy Family can be contrasted with other material in the Gospels . These references include an incident which can be interpreted as Jesus rejecting his family in the New Testament : " And his mother and his brothers arrived , and standing outside , they sent in a message asking for him ... And looking at those who sat in a circle around him , Jesus said , 'These are my mother and my brothers . Whoever does the will of God is my brother , and sister , and mother ' . " [ 3:31-35 ] Other verses suggest a conflict between Jesus and his family , including an attempt to have Jesus restrained because " he is out of his mind " , and the famous quote : " A prophet is not without honor except in his own town , among his relatives and in his own home . " A leading Biblical scholar commented : " there are clear signs not only that Jesus 's family rejected his message during his public ministry but that he in turn spurned them publicly " .
As of 2010 , those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry ancestry accounted for 22.5 % ( 4,223,806 ) of Florida 's population . Out of the 22.5 % , the largest groups were 6.5 % ( 1,213,438 ) Cuban , 4.5 % ( 847,550 ) Puerto Rican , 3.3 % ( 629,718 ) Mexican , and 1.6 % ( 300,414 ) Colombian . Florida 's Hispanic population includes large communities of Cuban Americans in Miami and Tampa , Puerto Ricans in Orlando and Tampa , and Mexican/Central American migrant workers . The Hispanic community continues to grow more affluent and mobile . As of 2011 , 57.0 % of Florida 's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups . Florida has a large and diverse Hispanic population , with Cubans and Puerto Ricans being the largest groups in the state . Nearly 80 % of Cuban Americans live in Florida , especially South Florida where there is a long-standing and affluent Cuban community . Florida has the second largest Puerto Rican population after New York , as well as the fastest-growing in the nation . Puerto Ricans are more widespread throughout the state , though the heaviest concentrations are in the Orlando area of Central Florida .
The period saw several important technical innovations , like the principle of linear perspective found in the work of Masaccio , and later described by Brunelleschi . Greater realism was also achieved through the scientific study of anatomy , championed by artists like Donatello . This can be seen particularly well in his sculptures , inspired by the study of classical models . As the centre of the movement shifted to Rome , the period culminated in the High Renaissance masters da Vinci , Michelangelo and Raphael .
Within the context of the overall murder rate , the death penalty can not be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States ; in recent years the average has been about one execution for about every 700 murders committed , or 1 execution for about every 325 murder convictions . However , 32 of the 50 states still execute people . Among them , Alabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences . This is due to judges overriding life imprisonment sentences and imposing the death penalty . No other states allow this .
The overcrowded conditions of the library was one of the reasons why the RIBA moved from 9 Conduit Street to larger premises at 66 Portland Place in 1934 . The library remained open throughout World War Two and was able to shelter the archives of Modernist architect Adolf Loos during the war .
The junior U.S . Senator from Massachusetts , Paul Tsongas , announced in 1984 that he would be stepping down for health reasons . Kerry ran , and as in his 1982 race for Lieutenant Governor , he did not receive the endorsement of the party regulars at the state Democratic convention . Congressman James Shannon , a favorite of House Speaker Tip O'Neill , was the early favorite to win the nomination , and he " won broad establishment support and led in early polling . " Again as in 1982 , however , Kerry prevailed in a close primary .
Ptolemy , a somatophylax , one of the seven bodyguards who served as Alexander the Great 's generals and deputies , was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander 's death in 323 BC . In 305 BC , he declared himself King Ptolemy I , later known as " Soter " ( saviour ) for his role in helping the Rhodians during the siege of Rhodes . Ptolemy built new cities such as Ptolemais Hermiou in upper Egypt and settled his veterans throughout the country , especially in the region of the Faiyum . Alexandria , a major center of Greek culture and trade , became his capital city . As Egypt 's first port city , it was the main grain exporter in the Mediterranean .
The U.S. framed the war as part of its policy of containment of Communism in south Asia , but American forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles , corruption and incompetence in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam , and ever increasing protests at home . The Tet Offensive in 1968 , although a major military defeat for the NLF with half their forces eliminated , marked the psychological turning point in the war . With President Richard M. Nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving détente with both the Soviet Union and China , American policy shifted to " Vietnamization , " – providing very large supplies of arms and letting the Vietnamese fight it out themselves . After more than 57,000 dead and many more wounded , American forces withdrew in 1973 with no clear victory , and in 1975 South Vietnam was finally conquered by communist North Vietnam and unified .
The Battle of Osan , the first significant American engagement of the Korean War , involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith , which was a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division which had been flown in from Japan . On 5 July 1950 , Task Force Smith attacked the North Koreans at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the North Koreans ' tanks . They were unsuccessful ; the result was 180 dead , wounded , or taken prisoner . The KPA progressed southwards , pushing back the US force at Pyongtaek , Chonan , and Chochiwon , forcing the 24th Division 's retreat to Taejeon , which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon ; the 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured , including the Division 's Commander , Major General William F. Dean .
During the Napoleonic Wars in the late 18th century and early 19th century , Napoleon annexed territory formerly controlled by the Habsburgs and Savoys . In 1798 he established the Helvetic Republic in Switzerland ; two years later he led an army across the St. Bernard pass and conquered almost all of the Alpine regions .
Northwestern is privately owned and is governed by an appointed Board of Trustees . The board , composed of 70 members and as of 2011 [ update ] chaired by William A. Osborn '69 , delegates its power to an elected president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university . Northwestern has had sixteen presidents in its history ( excluding interim presidents ) , the current president , Morton O. Schapiro , an economist , having succeeded Henry Bienen whose 14-year tenure ended on August 31 , 2009 . The president has a staff of vice presidents , directors , and other assistants for administrative , financial , faculty , and student matters . Daniel I. Linzer , provost since September 2007 , serves under the president as the chief academic officer of the university to whom the deans of every academic school , leaders of cross-disciplinary units , and chairs of the standing faculty committee report .
A synchronous electric motor is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the AC and resulting magnetic field which drives it . Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions . Contrast this with an induction motor , which must slip to produce torque . One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field . Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor . The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor . Another type , for low load torque , has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles . Yet another , such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks , and in the older Hammond organs , has no rotor windings and discrete poles . It is not self-starting . The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back , while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch .
The first great English translation was the Wycliffe Bible ( ca . 1382 ) , which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English prose . Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with Thomas Malory 's Le Morte Darthur—an adaptation of Arthurian romances so free that it can , in fact , hardly be called a true translation . The first great Tudor translations are , accordingly , the Tyndale New Testament ( 1525 ) , which influenced the Authorized Version ( 1611 ) , and Lord Berners ' version of Jean Froissart 's Chronicles ( 1523–25 ) .
Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt , while its plinth is made of malachite , a semi-precious stone . The plinth has a silver band around its circumference , upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed . Malachite 's green colour is also representative of the green field of play . The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football . Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title winning team as he raises the trophy , and its gold crown , above his head at the end of the season . The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year .
By May 15 , Premier Wen Jiabao ordered the deployment of an additional 90 helicopters , of which 60 were to be provided by the PLAAF , and 30 were to be provided by the civil aviation industry , bringing the total of number of aircraft deployed in relief operations by the air force , army , and civil aviation to over 150 , resulting in the largest non-combat airlifting operation in People 's Liberation Army history .
A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in those with asthma , including gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , rhinosinusitis , and obstructive sleep apnea . Psychological disorders are also more common , with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16–52 % and mood disorders in 14–41 % . However , it is not known if asthma causes psychological problems or if psychological problems lead to asthma . Those with asthma , especially if it is poorly controlled , are at high risk for radiocontrast reactions .
In Hindu mythology , Yama , the god of death owns two watch dogs who have four eyes . They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka . Hunter god Muthappan from North Malabar region of Kerala has a hunting dog as his mount . Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines .
Rare books are found in several Yale collections . The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts . The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts , including an impressive collection of rare books , as well as historical medical instruments . The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works . The Elizabethan Club , technically a private organization , makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale .
In April 1994 , the results of a Merck-sponsored study , the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study , were announced . Researchers tested simvastatin , later sold by Merck as Zocor , on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease . After five years , the study concluded the patients saw a 35 % reduction in their cholesterol , and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42 % . In 1995 , Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US $ 1 billion . Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize , and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008 . For his " pioneering research into a new class of molecules " for " lowering cholesterol , " [ sentence fragment ]
Oklahoma City was home to several pioneers in radio and television broadcasting . Oklahoma City 's WKY Radio was the first radio station transmitting west of the Mississippi River and the third radio station in the United States . WKY received its federal license in 1921 and has continually broadcast under the same call letters since 1922 . In 1928 , WKY was purchased by E.K . Gaylord 's Oklahoma Publishing Company and affiliated with the NBC Red Network ; in 1949 , WKY-TV ( channel 4 ) went on the air and later became the first independently owned television station in the U.S. to broadcast in color . In mid-2002 , WKY radio was purchased outright by Citadel Broadcasting , who was bought out by Cumulus Broadcasting in 2011 . The Gaylord family earlier sold WKY-TV in 1976 , which has gone through a succession of owners ( what is now KFOR-TV is currently owned by Tribune Broadcasting as of December 2013 ) .
The accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party . He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius , but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees . The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself , and the prefect , in order to prevent a serious outbreak , gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor . But the saint seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him . He quietly withdrew from Alexandria , 5 October , and took up his abode in a country house outside the city . Valens , who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak , within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his episcopal see .
Due to the expansion of trade and its geographical proximity , Kiev became the most important trade centre and chief among the communes ; therefore the leader of Kiev gained political " control " over the surrounding areas . This princedom emerged from a coalition of traditional patriarchic family communes banded together in an effort to increase the applicable workforce and expand the productivity of the land . This union developed the first major cities in the Rus ' and was the first notable form of self-government . As these communes became larger , the emphasis was taken off the family holdings and placed on the territory that surrounded . This shift in ideology became known as the verv ' .
To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes ( in 1995 ) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising , and does not exonerate the CRA . They contend that there were two , connected causes to the crisis : the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11 , 2001 . Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place . Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive , totaling $ 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007 . They also argue that the Federal Reserve ’ s classification of CRA loans as “ prime ” is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans ( 3 percentage points over average ) equal “ subprime ” loans .
Native Americans in the United States make up 0.97 % to 2 % of the population . In the 2010 census , 2.9 million people self-identified as Native American , Native Hawaiian , and Alaska Native alone , and 5.2 million people identified as U.S . Native Americans , either alone or in combination with one or more ethnicity or other races . 1.8 million are recognized as enrolled tribal members . [ citation needed ] Tribes have established their own criteria for membership , which are often based on blood quantum , lineal descent , or residency . A minority of US Native Americans live in land units called Indian reservations . Some California and Southwestern tribes , such as the Kumeyaay , Cocopa , Pascua Yaqui and Apache span both sides of the US–Mexican border . Haudenosaunee people have the legal right to freely cross the US–Canadian border . Athabascan , Tlingit , Haida , Tsimshian , Iñupiat , Blackfeet , Nakota , Cree , Anishinaabe , Huron , Lenape , Mi'kmaq , Penobscot , and Haudenosaunee , among others live in both Canada and the US .
Most French rulers since the Middle Ages made a point of leaving their mark on a city that , contrary to many other of the world 's capitals , has never been destroyed by catastrophe or war . In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries , Paris has preserved even its earliest history in its street map . [ citation needed ] At its origin , before the Middle Ages , the city was composed around several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine ; of those , two remain today : the île Saint-Louis , the île de la Cité ; a third one is the 1827 artificially created île aux Cygnes . Modern Paris owes much to its late 19th century Second Empire remodelling by the Baron Haussmann : many of modern Paris ' busiest streets , avenues and boulevards today are a result of that city renovation . Paris also owes its style to its aligned street-fronts , distinctive cream-grey " Paris stone " building ornamentation , aligned top-floor balconies , and tree-lined boulevards . The high residential population of its city centre makes it much different from most other western global cities .
Tsai writes that shortly after the visit by Deshin Shekpa , the Yongle Emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the Yangzi and Mekong Rivers in order to facilitate trade with Tibet in tea , horses , and salt . The trade route passed through Sichuan and crossed Shangri-La County in Yunnan . Wang and Nyima assert that this " tribute-related trade " of the Ming exchanging Chinese tea for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants— " furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet " . Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming . Peter C. Perdue says that Wang Anshi ( 1021–1086 ) , realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds , had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea . The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army 's supply wagons . The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement . The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets , but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions .
To protect crops from wind and drought , the Grain Intendant Zhao Guo ( 趙過 ) created the alternating fields system ( daitianfa 代田法 ) during Emperor Wu 's reign . This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons . Once experiments with this system yielded successful results , the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it . Han farmers also used the pit field system ( aotian 凹田 ) for growing crops , which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain . In southern and small parts of central Han-era China , paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice , while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production .
The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal . It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition , and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains . The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore . The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore , namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973 . Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty .
The styles that resulted fall within several categories . In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture— and its whimsical alternatives , Gothic and Chinoiserie , which were the English-speaking world 's equivalent of European Rococo . From the mid-1760s a range of Neoclassical modes were fashionable , associated with the British architects Robert Adam , James Gibbs , Sir William Chambers , James Wyatt , George Dance the Younger , Henry Holland and Sir John Soane . John Nash was one of the most prolific architects of the late Georgian era known as The Regency style , he was responsible for designing large areas of London . Greek Revival architecture was added to the repertory , beginning around 1750 , but increasing in popularity after 1800 . Leading exponents were William Wilkins and Robert Smirke .
Captain John Charles Marshall and Thomas Gilbert visited the islands in 1788 . The islands were named for Marshall on Western charts , although the natives have historically named their home " jolet jen Anij " ( Gifts from God ) . Around 1820 , Russian explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern and the French explorer Louis Isidore Duperrey named the islands after John Marshall , and drew maps of the islands . The designation was repeated later on British maps . [ citation needed ] In 1824 the crew of the American whaler Globe mutinied and some of the crew put ashore on Mulgrave Island . One year later , the American schooner Dolphin arrived and picked up two boys , the last survivors of a massacre by the natives due to their brutal treatment of the women . :2
New Delhi is a cosmopolitan city due to the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural presence of the vast Indian bureaucracy and political system . The city 's capital status has amplified the importance of national events and holidays . National events such as Republic Day , Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti ( Gandhi 's birthday ) are celebrated with great enthusiasm in New Delhi and the rest of India . On India 's Independence Day ( 15 August ) the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation from the Red Fort . Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites , which are considered a symbol of freedom . The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India 's cultural diversity and military might .
The first mention of the name " Rajasthan " appears in James Tod 's 1829 publication Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han or the Central and Western Rajpoot States of India , while the earliest known record of " Rajputana " as a name for the region is in George Thomas 's 1800 memoir Military Memories . John Keay , in his book India : A History , stated that " Rajputana " was coined by the British in 1829 , John Briggs , translating Ferishta 's history of early Islamic India , used the phrase " Rajpoot ( Rajput ) princes " rather than " Indian princes " .
A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee ( usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard , where all four limbs are incapacitated , making tapping impossible ) . Also , since Ken Shamrock ( a legitimate UFC competitor in its early days ) popularized it in 1997 , a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by " tapping out " , that is , tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent . Occasionally , a wrestler will reach for a rope ( see rope breaks below ) , only to put their hand back on the mat so they can crawl towards the rope some more ; this is not a submission , and the referee decides what their intent is .
The 2008 United Nations Human Rights Council report called " extremely credible " the description of the citizenship policy of Estonia as " discriminatory " . According to surveys , only 5 % of the Russian community have considered returning to Russia in the near future . Estonian Russians have developed their own identity – more than half of the respondents recognised that Estonian Russians differ noticeably from the Russians in Russia . When comparing the result with a survey from 2000 , then Russians ' attitude toward the future is much more positive .
Because of the vastness and diversity of the territory occupied by Slavic people , there were several centers of Slavic consolidation . In the 19th century , Pan-Slavism developed as a movement among intellectuals , scholars , and poets , but it rarely influenced practical politics and did not find support in some nations that had Slavic origins . Pan-Slavism became compromised when the Russian Empire started to use it as an ideology justifying its territorial conquests in Central Europe as well as subjugation of other ethnic groups of Slavic origins such as Poles and Ukrainians , and the ideology became associated with Russian imperialism . The common Slavic experience of communism combined with the repeated usage of the ideology by Soviet propaganda after World War II within the Eastern bloc ( Warsaw Pact ) was a forced high-level political and economic hegemony of the USSR dominated by Russians . A notable political union of the 20th century that covered most South Slavs was Yugoslavia , but it ultimately broke apart in the 1990s along with the Soviet Union .
Kanye West began his early production career in the mid-1990s , making beats primarily for burgeoning local artists , eventually developing a style that involved speeding up vocal samples from classic soul records . His first official production credits came at the age of nineteen when he produced eight tracks on Down to Earth , the 1996 debut album of a Chicago rapper named Grav . For a time , West acted as a ghost producer for Deric " D-Dot " Angelettie . Because of his association with D-Dot , West was n't able to release a solo album , so he formed and became a member and producer of the Go-Getters , a late-1990s Chicago rap group composed of him , GLC , Timmy G , Really Doe , and Arrowstar . His group was managed by John " Monopoly " Johnson , Don Crowley , and Happy Lewis under the management firm Hustle Period . After attending a series of promotional photo shoots and making some radio appearances , The Go-Getters released their first and only studio album World Record Holders in 1999 . The album featured other Chicago-based rappers such as Rhymefest , Mikkey Halsted , Miss Criss , and Shayla G. Meanwhile , the production was handled by West , Arrowstar , Boogz , and Brian " All Day " Miller .
Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law , but the other party does not . This factor has been at work with respect to discussions between North Korea and the United States over security guarantees and nuclear proliferation .
The National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education . Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace . By valuing diversity , employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population . By creating this diverse workforce , these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy . According to the U.S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a " company stronger , more profitable , and a better place to work . " Therefore , these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination , but have shown the value in having diversity .
In partnership with Gardiner Greene Hubbard , Bell helped establish the publication Science during the early 1880s . In 1898 , Bell was elected as the second president of the National Geographic Society , serving until 1903 , and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations , including photography , in the magazine . he also became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution ( 1898–1922 ) . The French government conferred on him the decoration of the Légion d'honneur ( Legion of Honor ) ; the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 1902 ; the University of Würzburg , Bavaria , granted him a PhD , and he was awarded the Franklin Institute 's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1912 . He was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884 , and served as its president from 1891–92 . Bell was later awarded the AIEE 's Edison Medal in 1914 " For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone " .
Some 97 percent of male BYU graduates and 32 percent of female graduates took a hiatus from their undergraduate studies at one point to serve as LDS missionaries . In October 2012 , the LDS Church announced at its general conference that young men could serve a mission after they turn 18 and have graduated from high school , rather than after age 19 under the old policy . Many young men would often attend a semester or two of higher education prior to beginning missionary service . This policy change will likely impact what has been the traditional incoming freshman class at BYU . Female students may now begin their missionary service anytime after turning 19 , rather than age 21 under the previous policy . For males , a full-time mission is two years in length , and for females it lasts 18 months .
The house which forms the architectural core of the palace was built for the first Duke of Buckingham and Normanby in 1703 to the design of William Winde . The style chosen was of a large , three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings . Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham 's descendant , Sir Charles Sheffield , in 1761 to George III for £21,000 . Sheffield 's leasehold on the mulberry garden site , the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family , was due to expire in 1774 .
Located in Yangtze River Delta area and the center of East China , Nanjing is home to one of the world 's largest inland ports . Nanjing is also one of the fifteen sub-provincial cities in the People 's Republic of China 's administrative structure , enjoying jurisdictional and economic autonomy only slightly less than that of a province . Nanjing has been ranked seventh in the evaluation of " Cities with Strongest Comprehensive Strength " issued by the National Statistics Bureau , and second in the evaluation of cities with most sustainable development potential in the Yangtze River Delta . It has also been awarded the title of 2008 Habitat Scroll of Honour of China , Special UN Habitat Scroll of Honour Award and National Civilized City . Nanjing boasts many high-quality universities and research institutes , with the number of universities listed in 100 National Key Universities ranking third , including Nanjing University . The ratio of college students to total population ranks No.1 among large cities nationwide . Nanjing is one of the three Chinese top research centres according to Nature Index .
The canal is 193.30 km ( 120.11 mi ) long , 24 m ( 79 ft ) deep and 205 metres ( 673 ft ) wide as of 2010 . It consists of the northern access channel of 22 km ( 14 mi ) , the canal itself of 162.25 km ( 100.82 mi ) and the southern access channel of 9 km ( 5.6 mi ) . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the " Ballah By-Pass " and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
On March 30 , 2015 , it was announced that West is a co-owner , with various other music artists , in the music streaming service Tidal . The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos . Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal , Aspiro , in the first quarter of 2015 . Including Beyoncé and Jay-Z , sixteen artist stakeholders ( such as Rihanna , Beyoncé , Madonna , Chris Martin , Nicki Minaj and more ) co-own Tidal , with the majority owning a 3 % equity stake . The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry , and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify , which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties . " The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again , to recognize its value " , stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal .
The target audience of natural history was French polite society , evidenced more by the specific discourse of the genre than by the generally high prices of its works . Naturalists catered to polite society 's desire for erudition – many texts had an explicit instructive purpose . However , natural history was often a political affair . As E. C. Spary writes , the classifications used by naturalists " slipped between the natural world and the social ... to establish not only the expertise of the naturalists over the natural , but also the dominance of the natural over the social " . The idea of taste ( le goût ) was a social indicator : to truly be able to categorize nature , one had to have the proper taste , an ability of discretion shared by all members of polite society . In this way natural history spread many of the scientific developments of the time , but also provided a new source of legitimacy for the dominant class . From this basis , naturalists could then develop their own social ideals based on their scientific works .
Changes this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten . Coca Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role . The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records .
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005 , after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before , but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season . UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League , giving England five qualifiers . UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . However , for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League , this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League . This occurred in 2012 , when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur , who went into the Europa League .
The expansive area northwest of the city limits is diverse , ranging from the rural communities of Catalina and parts of the town of Marana , the small suburb of Picture Rocks , the affluent town of Oro Valley in the western foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains , and residential areas in the northeastern foothills of the Tucson Mountains . Continental Ranch ( Marana ) , Dove Mountain ( Marana ) , and Rancho Vistoso ( Oro Valley ) are all masterplanned communities located in the Northwest , where thousands of residents live .
The history of the Seven Years ' War in North America , particularly the expulsion of the Acadians , the siege of Quebec , the death of Wolfe , and the Battle of Fort William Henry generated a vast number of ballads , broadsides , images , and novels ( see Longfellow 's Evangeline , Benjamin West 's The Death of General Wolfe , James Fenimore Cooper 's The Last of the Mohicans ) , maps and other printed materials , which testify to how this event held the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe 's death in 1759 .
Each year HHC 's facilities provide about 225,000 admissions , one million emergency room visits and five million clinic visits to New Yorkers . HHC facilities treat nearly one-fifth of all general hospital discharges and more than one third of emergency room and hospital-based clinic visits in New York City .
Beginning roughly in the 14th century in Florence , and later spreading through Europe with the development of the printing press , a Renaissance of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology , with the Arabic texts and thought bringing about rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge .
Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages . Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds ( in most dialects , i and y have the same sound ) , and it contains only one digraph : ch , which follows h in the alphabet . As a result , some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages . The characters q , w and x appear only in foreign words . The háček ( ˇ ) is used with certain letters to form new characters : š , ž , and č , as well as ň , ě , ř , ť , and ď ( the latter five uncommon outside Czech ) . The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above ( ʼ , an abbreviated háček ) because of their height . The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia .
Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League . The League 's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision , but one that has paid off . At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market , as was charging fans to watch live televised football . However , a combination of Sky 's strategy , the quality of Premier League football and the public 's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League 's TV rights soar .
In the 2010s , American jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs , due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume . Hospira , the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped making the drug in 2011 . The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution ; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes . Another alternative , pentobarbital , is also only manufactured in the European Union , which has caused the Danish producer to restrict distribution to U.S. government customers .
By 1860 , Houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton . Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston , where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and Beaumont . During the American Civil War , Houston served as a headquarters for General John Bankhead Magruder , who used the city as an organization point for the Battle of Galveston . After the Civil War , Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city 's extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston . By 1890 , Houston was the railroad center of Texas .
New Haven has a long tradition of urban planning and a purposeful design for the city 's layout . The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country . Upon founding , New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks ; the central square was left open , in the tradition of many New England towns , as the city green ( a commons area ) . The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America . As in other cities , many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname " Elm City " perished in the mid-20th century due to Dutch Elm disease , although many have since been replanted . The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city . The Green remains the social center of the city today . It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970 .
The school broke off from the University of Deseret and became Brigham Young Academy , with classes commencing on January 3 , 1876 . Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April 1876 when Brigham Young 's choice for principal arrived—a German immigrant named Karl Maeser . Under Maeser 's direction the school educated many luminaries including future U.S. Supreme Court Justice George Sutherland and future U.S . Senator Reed Smoot among others . The school , however , did not become a university until the end of Benjamin Cluff , Jr 's term at the helm of the institution . At that time , the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18 , 1896 . A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion ; however , in his last official act , he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named " Brigham Young University " . The suggestion received a large amount of opposition , with many members of the Board saying that the school was n't large enough to be a university , but the decision ultimately passed . One opponent to the decision , Anthon H. Lund , later said , " I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat . "
The song was released as a digital download on 25 September 2015 . It received mixed reviews from critics and fans , particularly in comparison to Adele 's " Skyfall " . The mixed reception to the song led to Shirley Bassey trending on Twitter on the day it was released . It became the first Bond theme to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart . The English band Radiohead also composed a song for the film , which went unused .
As of 2000 [ update ] , children and teenagers ( 0–19 years old ) make up 15.1 % of the population , while adults ( 20–64 years old ) make up 65 % and seniors ( over 64 years old ) make up 19.9 % .
Initially , officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve , home to around 280 giant pandas . However , the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu . Nonetheless , the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown . Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake . Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged . By May 20 , two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured , while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake . By May 28 , 2008 , one panda was still missing . The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure . Nine-year-old Mao Mao , a mother of five at the breeding center , was discovered on Monday , her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure . Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre .
Eton is one of ten English HMC schools , commonly referred to as " public schools " , regulated by the Public Schools Act of 1868 . Following the public school tradition , Eton is a full boarding school , which means all pupils live at the school , and it is one of four such remaining single-sex boys ' public schools in the United Kingdom ( the others being Harrow , Radley , and Winchester ) to continue this practice . Eton has educated 19 British prime ministers and generations of the aristocracy and has been referred to as the chief nurse of England 's statesmen . Charging up to £11,478 per term ( there are three terms per academic year ) in 2014/15 , Eton is the sixth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK .
The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways . For example , classical mechanics distinguishes between kinetic energy , which is determined by an object 's movement through space , and potential energy , which is a function of the position of an object within a field . It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy , thermal energy , several types of nuclear energy ( which utilize potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force ) , electric energy ( from the electric field ) , and magnetic energy ( from the magnetic field ) , among others . Many of these classifications overlap ; for instance , thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy .
It is believed that Nanjing was the largest city in the world from 1358 to 1425 with a population of 487,000 in 1400 . Nanjing remained the capital of the Ming Empire until 1421 , when the third emperor of the Ming dynasty , the Yongle Emperor , relocated the capital to Beijing .
The Sultanate of Ifat , led by the Walashma dynasty with its capital at Zeila , ruled over parts of what is now eastern Ethiopia , Djibouti , and northern Somalia . The historian al-Umari records that Ifat was situated near the Red Sea coast , and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel . Its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers . Al-Umari also credits Ifat with seven " mother cities " : Belqulzar , Kuljura , Shimi , Shewa , Adal , Jamme and Laboo .
The term " high fidelity " was coined in the 1920s by some manufacturers of radio receivers and phonographs to differentiate their better-sounding products claimed as providing " perfect " sound reproduction . The term began to be used by some audio engineers and consumers through the 1930s and 1940s . After 1949 a variety of improvements in recording and playback technologies , especially stereo recordings , which became widely available in 1958 , gave a boost to the " hi-fi " classification of products , leading to sales of individual components for the home such as amplifiers , loudspeakers , phonographs , and tape players . High Fidelity and Audio were two magazines that hi-fi consumers and engineers could read for reviews of playback equipment and recordings .
Standing at 117 metres ( 384 feet ) in height and 360 metres ( 1,180 feet ) in width , the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture . Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama , it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories , and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha . It is divided between the outer White Palace , which serves as the administrative quarters , and the inner Red Quarters , which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas , chapels , 10,000 shrines , and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures . The Potala Palace is a World Heritage Site , as is Norbulingka , the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama .
Large numbers of Bolivian highland peasants retained indigenous language , culture , customs , and communal organization throughout the Spanish conquest and the post-independence period . They mobilized to resist various attempts at the dissolution of communal landholdings and used legal recognition of " empowered caciques " to further communal organization . Indigenous revolts took place frequently until 1953 . While the National Revolutionary Movement government begun in 1952 discouraged self-identification as indigenous ( reclassifying rural people as campesinos , or peasants ) , renewed ethnic and class militancy re-emerged in the Katarista movement beginning in the 1970s . Lowland indigenous peoples , mostly in the east , entered national politics through the 1990 March for Territory and Dignity organized by the CIDOB confederation . That march successfully pressured the national government to sign the ILO Convention 169 and to begin the still-ongoing process of recognizing and titling indigenous territories . The 1994 Law of Popular Participation granted " grassroots territorial organizations " that are recognized by the state certain rights to govern local areas .
Throughout Europe at this time there was a rapid growth in trade and an associated growth in towns . Germany and the Lowlands had large flourishing towns that grew in comparative peace , in trade and competition with each other , or united for mutual weal , as in the Hanseatic League . Civic building was of great importance to these towns as a sign of wealth and pride . England and France remained largely feudal and produced grand domestic architecture for their kings , dukes and bishops , rather than grand town halls for their burghers .
Literature consists of written productions , often restricted to those deemed to have artistic or intellectual value . Its Latin root literatura/litteratura ( derived itself from littera , letter or handwriting ) was used to refer to all written accounts , but intertwined with the roman concept of cultura : learning or cultivation . Literature often uses language differently than ordinary language ( see literariness ) . Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose ; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel , short story or drama ; and works are often categorised according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations ( genre ) .
Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s , Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science , and finally to metaphysics . He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy . Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects , and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes , thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another . Today Whitehead 's philosophical works – particularly Process and Reality – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy .
The events of the Franco-Prussian War had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years . Lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system , the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry . The bold use of artillery by the Prussians , to silence French guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range , proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by French gunners . The Prussian tactics were adopted by European armies by 1914 , exemplified in the French 75 , an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry . Most European armies ignored the evidence of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively . This forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire , usually from a position of cover .
DC systems ( especially third-rail systems ) are limited to relatively low voltages and this can limit the size and speed of trains and can not use low-level platform and also limit the amount of air-conditioning that the trains can provide . This may be a factor favouring overhead wires and high-voltage AC , even for urban usage . In practice , the top speed of trains on third-rail systems is limited to 100 mph ( 160 km/h ) because above that speed reliable contact between the shoe and the rail can not be maintained .
In a series of famous papers , von Neumann made spectacular contributions to measure theory . The work of Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1 or n = 2 and a negative solution in all other cases . Von Neumann 's work argued that the " problem is essentially group-theoretic in character , and that , in particular , for the solvability of the problem of measure the ordinary algebraic concept of solvability of a group is relevant . Thus , according to von Neumann , it is the change of group that makes a difference , not the change of space . "
The SI unit of pressure is the pascal ( symbol Pa ) , but vacuum is often measured in torrs , named for Torricelli , an early Italian physicist ( 1608–1647 ) . A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury ( mmHg ) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure . Vacuum is often also measured on the barometric scale or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres . Low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmHg ) or pascals ( Pa ) below standard atmospheric pressure . " Below atmospheric " means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure .
Houston 's highway system has a hub-and-spoke freeway structure serviced by multiple loops . The innermost loop is Interstate 610 , which encircles downtown , the medical center , and many core neighborhoods with around a 8-mile ( 13 km ) diameter . Beltway 8 and its freeway core , the Sam Houston Tollway , form the middle loop at a diameter of roughly 23 miles ( 37 km ) . A proposed highway project , State Highway 99 ( Grand Parkway ) , will form a third loop outside of Houston , totaling 180 miles in length and making an almost-complete circumference , with the exception of crossing the ship channel . As of June 2014 , two of eleven segments of State Highway 99 have been completed to the west of Houston , and three northern segments , totaling 38 miles , are actively under construction and scheduled to open to traffic late in 2015 . In addition to the Sam Houston Tollway loop mentioned above , the Harris County Toll Road Authority currently operates four spoke tollways : The Katy Managed Lanes of Interstate 10 , the Hardy Toll Road , the Westpark Tollway , and the Fort Bend Parkway Extension . Other spoke roads either planned or under construction include Crosby Freeway , and the future Alvin Freeway .
The American Civil War caught both sides unprepared . The Confederacy hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene , or else by wearing down the North 's willingness to fight . The U.S. sought a quick victory focused on capturing the Confederate capital at Richmond , Virginia . The Confederates under Robert E. Lee tenaciously defended their capital until the very end . The war spilled across the continent , and even to the high seas . Most of the material and personnel of the South were used up , while the North prospered .
The islands were first sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha ; rough seas prevented a landing . He named the main island after himself , Ilha de Tristão da Cunha , which was anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts to Tristan da Cunha Island . Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520 , when the Lás Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water . The first undisputed landing was made in 1643 by the crew of the Heemstede , captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot .
China Mobile had more than 2,300 base stations suspended due to power disruption or severe telecommunication traffic congestion . Half of the wireless communications were lost in the Sichuan province . China Unicom 's service in Wenchuan and four nearby counties was cut off , with more than 700 towers suspended .
Galicia is poetically known as the " country of the thousand rivers " ( " o país dos mil ríos " ) . The largest and most important of these rivers is the Minho , known as O Pai Miño ( Father Minho ) , 307.5 km ( 191.1 mi ) long and discharging 419 m3 ( 548 cu yd ) per second , with its affluent the Sil , which has created a spectacular canyon . Most of the rivers in the inland are tributaries of this fluvial system , which drains some 17,027 km2 ( 6,574 sq mi ) . Other rivers run directly into the Atlantic Ocean as Lérez or the Cantabrian Sea , most of them having short courses . Only the Navia , Ulla , Tambre , and Limia have courses longer than 100 km ( 62 mi ) .
In modern languages the term alp , alm , albe or alpe refers to a grazing pastures in the alpine regions below the glaciers , not the peaks . An alp refers to a high mountain pasture where cows are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where hay barns can be found , and the term " the Alps " , referring to the mountains , is a misnomer . The term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language : words such as horn , kogel , gipfel , spitz , and berg are used in German speaking regions : mont , pic , dent and aiguille in French speaking regions ; and monte , picco or cima in Italian speaking regions .
In what was to become a tradition , Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale , and released the song immediately after the season ended . The single , " A Moment Like This " , went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so . Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film , From Justin to Kelly , which was released in 2003 but was widely panned . Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant internationally , with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million .
In December , Beyoncé along with a variety of other celebrities teamed up and produced a video campaign for " Demand A Plan " , a bipartisan effort by a group of 950 US mayors and others designed to influence the federal government into rethinking its gun control laws , following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . Beyoncé became an ambassador for the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign donating her song " I Was Here " and its music video , shot in the UN , to the campaign . In 2013 , it was announced that Beyoncé would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on a Gucci " Chime for Change " campaign that aims to spread female empowerment . The campaign , which aired on February 28 , was set to her new music . A concert for the cause took place on June 1 , 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding , Florence and the Machine , and Rita Ora . In advance of the concert , she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013 , where she , along with Cameron Diaz , John Legend and Kylie Minogue , described inspiration from their mothers , while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women , leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers ' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert . Beyoncé said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was " finding the best qualities in every human being . " With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult , visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls . Beyoncé is also taking part in " Miss a Meal " , a food-donation campaign , and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S .
At the end of the third quarter in 2008 , Florida had the highest mortgage delinquency rate in the country , with 7.8 % of mortgages delinquent at least 60 days . A 2009 list of national housing markets that were hard hit in the real estate crash included a disproportionate number in Florida . The early 21st-century building boom left Florida with 300,000 vacant homes in 2009 , according to state figures . In 2009 , the US Census Bureau estimated that Floridians spent an average 49.1 % of personal income on housing-related costs , the third highest percentage in the country .
Directive 23 was the only concession made by Göring to the Kriegsmarine over the strategic bombing strategy of the Luftwaffe against Britain . Thereafter , he would refuse to make available any air units to destroy British dockyards , ports , port facilities , or shipping in dock or at sea , lest Kriegsmarine gain control of more Luftwaffe units . Raeder 's successor—Karl Dönitz—would—on the intervention of Hitler—gain control of one unit ( KG 40 ) , but Göring would soon regain it . Göring 's lack of cooperation was detrimental to the one air strategy with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain . Instead , he wasted aircraft of Fliegerführer Atlantik ( Flying Command Atlantic ) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against convoys . For Göring , his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain , and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone . He was always reluctant to cooperate with Raeder .
The Prussian army was controlled by the General Staff , under Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke . The Prussian army was unique in Europe for having the only such organisation in existence , whose purpose in peacetime was to prepare the overall war strategy , and in wartime to direct operational movement and organise logistics and communications . The officers of the General Staff were hand-picked from the Prussian Kriegsakademie ( War Academy ) . Moltke embraced new technology , particularly the railroad and telegraph , to coordinate and accelerate mobilisation of large forces .
The World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories . They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars ; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter , which reduces the emissions released . Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) . Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion . Today it has over 201 km ( 125 mi ) of track and carries over 5 million people every day . Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great , that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women . Due to these initiatives and others , the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve , with the air becoming cleaner since 1991 , when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year .

Isabelle Stengers wrote that " Whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians , and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons , from ecology to feminism , practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education . " Indeed , in recent decades attention to Whitehead 's work has become more widespread , with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China , and coming from such diverse fields as ecology , physics , biology , education , economics , and psychology . One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead 's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury , William Temple . In Temple 's Gifford Lectures of 1932-1934 ( subsequently published as " Nature , Man and God " ) , Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach Temple interacts with . However , it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead 's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians , primarily Americans , and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles .
Beginning in the tenth season [ citation needed ] , permanent mentors were brought in during the live shows to help guide the contestants with their song choice and performance . Jimmy Iovine was the mentor in the tenth through twelfth seasons , former judge Randy Jackson was the mentor for the thirteenth season and Scott Borchetta was the mentor for the fourteenth and fifteenth season . The mentors regularly bring in guest mentors to aid them , including Akon , Alicia Keys , Lady Gaga , and current judge Harry Connick , Jr..
Average annual precipitation is 15 inches ( 380 mm ) , but great variations are seen . The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air , holding moisture in the western valleys , and creating rain shadows to the east . Heron , in the west , receives the most precipitation , 34.70 inches ( 881 mm ) . On the eastern ( leeward ) side of a mountain range , the valleys are much drier ; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches ( 291 mm ) , and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches ( 279 mm ) of precipitation . The mountains themselves can receive over 100 inches ( 2,500 mm ) , for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches ( 2,700 mm ) . An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches ( 167 mm ) over a sixteen-year period . Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 metres of snow each year . Mountain ranges themselves can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 metres of snow during a winter . Heavy snowstorms may occur any time from September through May , though most snow falls from November to March .
The assertion that the Cubist depiction of space , mass , time , and volume supports ( rather than contradicts ) the flatness of the canvas was made by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler as early as 1920 , but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s , especially by Clement Greenberg . Contemporary views of Cubism are complex , formed to some extent in response to the " Salle 41 " Cubists , whose methods were too distinct from those of Picasso and Braque to be considered merely secondary to them . Alternative interpretations of Cubism have therefore developed . Wider views of Cubism include artists who were later associated with the " Salle 41 " artists , e.g. , Francis Picabia ; the brothers Jacques Villon , Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp , who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the Section d'Or ( or the Puteaux Group ) ; the sculptors Alexander Archipenko , Joseph Csaky and Ossip Zadkine as well as Jacques Lipchitz and Henri Laurens ; and painters such as Louis Marcoussis , Roger de La Fresnaye , František Kupka , Diego Rivera , Léopold Survage , Auguste Herbin , André Lhote , Gino Severini ( after 1916 ) , María Blanchard ( after 1916 ) and Georges Valmier ( after 1918 ) . More fundamentally , Christopher Green argues that Douglas Cooper 's terms were " later undermined by interpretations of the work of Picasso , Braque , Gris and Léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation . "
In 1989 , Linda Ronstadt released Cry Like a Rainstorm , Howl Like the Wind , described by critics as " the first true Adult Contemporary album of the decade " , featuring American soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the twelve tracks . The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe . The Grammy Award-winning singles , " Do n't Know Much " and " All My Life " , were both long-running # 1 Adult Contemporary hits . Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well . The album won over many critics in the need to define AC , and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play .
Programmes , such as the politically fuelled Give My Head Peace ( produced by BBC Northern Ireland ) and the soap opera River City ( produced by BBC Scotland ) , have been created specifically to cater for some viewers in their respective nations , who may have found programmes created for English audiences irrelevant . BBC Scotland produces daily programmes for its Gaelic-speaking viewers , including current affairs , political and children 's programming such as the popular Eòrpa and Dè a-nis ? . BBC Wales also produces a large amount of Welsh language programming for S4C , particularly news , sport and other programmes , especially the soap opera Pobol y Cwm ( 'People of the Valley ' ) . The UK nations also produce a number of programmes that are shown across the UK , such as BBC Scotland 's comedy series Chewin ' the Fat , and BBC Northern Ireland 's talk show Patrick Kielty Almost Live .
One of the most complex characters found in modern Chinese dictionaries [ g ] is 齉 ( U+9F49 ) ( nàng , listen ( help·info ) , pictured below , middle image ) , meaning " snuffle " ( that is , a pronunciation marred by a blocked nose ) , with " just " thirty-six strokes . However , this is not in common use . The most complex character that can be input using the Microsoft New Phonetic IME 2002a for traditional Chinese is 龘 ( dá , " the appearance of a dragon flying " ) . It is composed of the dragon radical represented three times , for a total of 16 × 3 = 48 strokes . Among the most complex characters in modern dictionaries and also in frequent modern use are 籲 ( yù , " to implore " ) , with 32 strokes ; 鬱 ( yù , " luxuriant , lush ; gloomy " ) , with 29 strokes , as in 憂鬱 ( yōuyù , " depressed " ) ; 豔 ( yàn , " colorful " ) , with 28 strokes ; and 釁 ( xìn , " quarrel " ) , with 25 strokes , as in 挑釁 ( tiǎoxìn , " to pick a fight " ) . Also in occasional modern use is 鱻 ( xiān " fresh " ; variant of 鮮 xiān ) with 33 strokes .
Due to the 1973 spike in oil prices , the economy of Iran was flooded with foreign currency , which caused inflation . By 1974 , the economy of Iran was experiencing double digit inflation , and despite many large projects to modernize the country , corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste . By 1975 and 1976 , an economic recession led to increased unemployment , especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s . By the late 1970s , many of these people opposed the Shah 's regime and began to organize and join the protests against it .
Ranthambore National Park is known worldwide for its tiger population and is considered by both wilderness lovers and photographers as one of the best place in India to spot tigers . At one point , due to poaching and negligence , tigers became extinct at Sariska , but five tigers have been relocated there . Prominent among the wildlife sanctuaries are Mount Abu Sanctuary , Bhensrod Garh Sanctuary , Darrah Sanctuary , Jaisamand Sanctuary , Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary , Jawahar Sagar sanctuary , and Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary .
Greater London 's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War , from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s . The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury , with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration , including the Canary Wharf development . This was borne out of London 's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s . The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea .
Offensive Counterair ( OCA ) is defined as " offensive operations to destroy , disrupt , or neutralize enemy aircraft , missiles , launch platforms , and their supporting structures and systems both before and after launch , but as close to their source as possible " ( JP 1-02 ) . OCA is the preferred method of countering air and missile threats , since it attempts to defeat the enemy closer to its source and typically enjoys the initiative . OCA comprises attack operations , sweep , escort , and suppression/destruction of enemy air defense .

Czech , the official language of the Czech Republic ( a member of the European Union since 2004 ) , is one of the EU 's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia . Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages . The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic ( 98.77 percent ) , Slovakia ( 24.86 percent ) , Portugal ( 1.93 percent ) , Poland ( 0.98 percent ) and Germany ( 0.47 percent ) .
Capacitors may have their connecting leads arranged in many configurations , for example axially or radially . " Axial " means that the leads are on a common axis , typically the axis of the capacitor 's cylindrical body – the leads extend from opposite ends . Radial leads might more accurately be referred to as tandem ; they are rarely actually aligned along radii of the body 's circle , so the term is inexact , although universal . The leads ( until bent ) are usually in planes parallel to that of the flat body of the capacitor , and extend in the same direction ; they are often parallel as manufactured .
A substantial number of artists and other figures have been influenced by , or complimented , West 's work , including hip hop artists RZA of Wu-Tang Clan , Chuck D of Public Enemy , and DJ Premier of Gang Starr . Both Drake and Casey Veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by West . Non-rap artists such as English singer-songwriters Adele and Lily Allen , New Zealand artist Lorde , rock band Arctic Monkeys , pop singer Halsey , Sergio Pizzorno of English rock band Kasabian and American indie rock group MGMT have cited West as an influence . Experimental and electronic artists such as James Blake Daniel Lopatin , and Tim Hecker have also cited West 's work as an inspiration . Experimental rock pioneer and Velvet Underground founder Lou Reed , in a review of West 's album Yeezus , wrote that " the guy really , really , really is talented . He 's really trying to raise the bar . No one 's near doing what he ’ s doing , it ’ s not even on the same planet . " Musicians such as Paul McCartney and Prince have also commended West 's work . Famed Tesla Motors CEO and inventor Elon Musk complimented West in a piece for Time Magazine 's 100 most influential people list , writing that :
It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season , but worries of injuries to players , along with travel issues , have made this very rare . Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues , like Chicago 's Crosstown Classic and New York 's Subway Series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play . The annual MLB All-Star Game , played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams , was long considered an exhibition match , but as of 2003 this status was questioned because the league whose team wins the All-Star game has been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming World Series .
Several subsets of Unicode are standardized : Microsoft Windows since Windows NT 4.0 supports WGL-4 with 652 characters , which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin , Greek , or Cyrillic script . Other standardized subsets of Unicode include the Multilingual European Subsets : MES-1 ( Latin scripts only , 335 characters ) , MES-2 ( Latin , Greek and Cyrillic 1062 characters ) and MES-3A & MES-3B ( two larger subsets , not shown here ) . Note that MES-2 includes every character in MES-1 and WGL-4 .
Its knowledge and uses spread from China through the Middle East to medieval Europe in the 13th century , where the first water powered paper mills were built . Because of paper 's introduction to the West through the city of Baghdad , it was first called bagdatikos . In the 19th century , industrial manufacture greatly lowered its cost , enabling mass exchange of information and contributing to significant cultural shifts . In 1844 , the Canadian inventor Charles Fenerty and the German F. G. Keller independently developed processes for pulping wood fibres .
One philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American pragmatism . Whitehead himself thought highly of William James and John Dewey , and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to Process and Reality . Charles Hartshorne ( along with Paul Weiss ) edited the collected papers of Charles Sanders Peirce , one of the founders of pragmatism . Noted neopragmatist Richard Rorty was in turn a student of Hartshorne . Today , Nicholas Rescher is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism .
According to the Sichuan Department of Commerce , the province 's total foreign trade was US $ 22.04 billion in 2008 , with an annual increase of 53.3 percent . Exports were US $ 13.1 billion , an annual increase of 52.3 percent , while imports were US $ 8.93 billion , an annual increase of 54.7 percent . These achievements were accomplished because of significant changes in China 's foreign trade policy , acceleration of the yuan 's appreciation , increase of commercial incentives and increase in production costs . The 18 cities and counties witnessed a steady rate of increase . Chengdu , Suining , Nanchong , Dazhou , Ya'an , Abazhou , and Liangshan all saw an increase of more than 40 percent while Leshan , Neijiang , Luzhou , Meishan , Ziyang , and Yibin saw an increase of more than 20 percent . Foreign trade in Zigong , Panzhihua , Guang'an , Bazhong and Ganzi remained constant .
When an inductive circuit is opened , the current through the inductance collapses quickly , creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay . If the inductance is large enough , the energy will generate a spark , causing the contact points to oxidize , deteriorate , or sometimes weld together , or destroying a solid-state switch . A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points , thereby preserving their life ; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems , for instance . Similarly , in smaller scale circuits , the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference ( RFI ) , which a filter capacitor absorbs . Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series , to dissipate energy and minimize RFI . Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package .
Malian migrants have long worked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast , but in 2000 cocoa prices had dropped to a 10-year low and some farmers stopped paying their employees . The Malian counsel had to rescue some boys who had not been paid for five years and who were beaten if they tried to run away . Malian officials believed that 15,000 children , some as young as 11 years old , were working in the Ivory Coast in 2001 . These children were often from poor families or the slums and were sold to work in other countries . Parents were told the children would find work and send money home , but once the children left home , they often worked in conditions resembling slavery . In other cases , children begging for food were lured from bus stations and sold as slaves . In 2002 , the Ivory Coast had 12,000 children with no relatives nearby , which suggested they were trafficked , likely from neighboring Mali , Burkina Faso and Togo .
On August 9 , 2015 , ESPN reported that the New Orleans VooDoo and Las Vegas Outlaws had ceased operations , effective immediately , a claim which was subsequently validated on the AFL website . On September 1 , 2015 , the Spokane Shock officially left the AFL and joined the IFL under the new name Spokane Empire , becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since bankruptcy ( Iowa Barnstormers , Tri-Cities Fever , Green Bay Blizzard and Arkansas Twisters—now the Texas Revolution—left previously ) .
The era began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event , the largest well-documented mass extinction in Earth 's history , and ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , another mass extinction which is known for having killed off non-avian dinosaurs , as well as other plant and animal species . The Mesozoic was a time of significant tectonic , climate and evolutionary activity . The era witnessed the gradual rifting of the supercontinent Pangaea into separate landmasses that would eventually move into their current positions . The climate of the Mesozoic was varied , alternating between warming and cooling periods . Overall , however , the Earth was hotter than it is today . Non-avian dinosaurs appeared in the Late Triassic and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates early in the Jurassic , occupying this position for about 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous . Birds first appeared in the Jurassic , having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs . The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic , but would remain small—less than 15 kg ( 33 lb ) —until the Cenozoic .
Under the Köppen climate classification , using the 0 °C ( 32 °F ) coldest month ( January ) isotherm , New York City itself experiences a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) and is thus the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization . The suburbs to the immediate north and west lie in the transition zone from a humid subtropical ( Cfa ) to a humid continental climate ( Dfa ) . The area averages 234 days with at least some sunshine annually , and averages 57 % of possible sunshine annually , accumulating 2,535 hours of sunshine per annum . The city falls under USDA 7b Plant Hardiness zone .
Chopin 's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange 's fiancé , the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Clésinger . The composer frequently took Solange 's side in quarrels with her mother ; he also faced jealousy from Sand 's son Maurice . Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand 's radical political pursuits , while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain . As the composer 's illness progressed , Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin , whom she called her " third child " . In letters to third parties , she vented her impatience , referring to him as a " child , " a " little angel " , a " sufferer " and a " beloved little corpse . " In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani , whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin ; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin , who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer 's galleys . In 1847 he did not visit Nohant , and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which , in Sand 's words , made " a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship . " The two would never meet again .
Special bundles of the game contain a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine , which unlocks a Wii U-exclusive dungeon called the " Cave of Shadows " and can carry data over to the upcoming 2016 Zelda game . Other Zelda-related Amiibo figurines have distinct functions : Link and Toon Link replenish arrows , Zelda and Sheik restore Link 's health , and Ganondorf causes Link to take twice as much damage .
The rebels made the first move in the war , seizing the strategic Rochester Castle , owned by Langton but left almost unguarded by the archbishop . John was well prepared for a conflict . He had stockpiled money to pay for mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces , such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester . The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south . John 's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London , protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders , prevent the French from landing in the south-east , and then win the war through slow attrition . John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales , where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement .
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade , alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK . This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana 's Nevermind ( 1991 ) , which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a " dirty " sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion , fuzz and feedback , along with darker lyrical themes than their " hair band " predecessors . Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock , several , including Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden , were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal , while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock . However , all grunge bands shunned the macho , anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal . In the UK , Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound .
Iran received access to the Internet in 1993 . According to 2014 census , around 40 % of the population of Iran are Internet users . Iran ranks 24th among countries by number of Internet users . According to the statistics provided by the web information company of Alexa , Google Search and Yahoo ! are the most used search engines in Iran . Over 80 % of the users of Telegram , a cloud-based instant messaging service , are from Iran . Instagram is the most popular online social networking service in Iran . Direct access to Facebook has been blocked in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests , due to organization of the opposition movements on the website ; but however , Facebook has around 12 to 17 million users in Iran who are using virtual private networks and proxy servers to access the website . Around 90 % of Iran 's e-commerce takes place on the Iranian online store of Digikala , which has around 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers . Digikala is the most visited online store in the Middle East , and ranks 4th among the most visited websites in Iran .
Cladistics is another method of classification . A clade is a taxonomic group of organisms consisting of a single common ancestor and all the descendants of that ancestor . Every creature produced by sexual reproduction has two immediate lineages , one maternal and one paternal . Whereas Carl Linnaeus established a taxonomy of living organisms based on anatomical similarities and differences , cladistics seeks to establish a taxonomy—the phylogenetic tree—based on genetic similarities and differences and tracing the process of acquisition of multiple characteristics by single organisms . Some researchers have tried to clarify the idea of race by equating it to the biological idea of the clade . Often mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome sequences are used to study ancient human migration paths . These single-locus sources of DNA do not recombine and are inherited from a single parent . Individuals from the various continental groups tend to be more similar to one another than to people from other continents , and tracing either mitochondrial DNA or non-recombinant Y-chromosome DNA explains how people in one place may be largely derived from people in some remote location .
The performance of " Summertime " by Barrino , later known simply as " Fantasia " , at Top 8 was widely praised , and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show . Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists , and Fantasia was crowned as the winner . Fantasia released as her coronation single " I Believe " , a song co-written by season one finalist Tamyra Gray , and DeGarmo released " Dreams " . Fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist , while Hudson , who placed seventh , became the only Idol contestant so far to win both an Academy Award and a Grammy .
The Israeli Space Agency coordinates all Israeli space research programs with scientific and commercial goals . In 2012 Israel was ranked ninth in the world by the Futron 's Space Competitiveness Index . Israel is one of only seven countries that both build their own satellites and launch their own launchers . The Shavit is a space launch vehicle produced by Israel to launch small satellites into low earth orbit . It was first launched in 1988 , making Israel the eighth nation to have a space launch capability . Shavit rockets are launched from the spaceport at the Palmachim Airbase by the Israeli Space Agency . Since 1988 Israel Aerospace Industries have indigenously designed and built at least 13 commercial , research and spy satellites . Some of Israel 's satellites are ranked among the world 's most advanced space systems . In 2003 , Ilan Ramon became Israel 's first astronaut , serving as payload specialist of STS-107 , the fatal mission of the Space Shuttle Columbia .
The NBA 's New Orleans Hornets became the first major league sports franchise based in Oklahoma when the team was forced to relocate to Oklahoma City 's Ford Center , now known as Chesapeake Energy Arena , for two seasons following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . In July 2008 , the Seattle SuperSonics , a franchise owned by the Professional Basketball Club LLC , a group of Oklahoma City businessmen led by Clayton Bennett , relocated to Oklahoma City and announced that play would begin at the Ford Center as the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season , becoming the state 's first permanent major league franchise .
On January 7 , 2012 , Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter , Blue Ivy Carter , at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York under heavy security . Two days later , Jay Z released " Glory " , a song dedicated to their child , on his website Lifeandtimes.com . The song detailed the couple 's pregnancy struggles , including a miscarriage Beyoncé suffered before becoming pregnant with Blue Ivy . Blue Ivy 's cries are included at the end of the song , and she was officially credited as " B.I.C . " on it . At two days old , she became the youngest person ever to appear on a Billboard chart when " Glory " debuted on the Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs chart .
Some high-speed black-and-white films , such as Ilford Delta 3200 and Kodak T-MAX P3200 , are marketed with film speeds in excess of their true ISO speed as determined using the ISO testing method . For example , the Ilford product is actually an ISO 1000 film , according to its data sheet . The manufacturers do not indicate that the 3200 number is an ISO rating on their packaging . Kodak and Fuji also marketed E6 films designed for pushing ( hence the " P " prefix ) , such as Ektachrome P800/1600 and Fujichrome P1600 , both with a base speed of ISO 400 .
Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power , with significant cultural , political , and military influence in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world . Its economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East , with sectors such as tourism , agriculture , industry and services at almost equal production levels . In 2011 , longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid mass protests . Later elections saw the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood , which was ousted by the army a year later amid mass protests .
The culture of Eritrea has been largely shaped by the country 's location on the Red Sea coast . One of the most recognizable parts of Eritrean culture is the coffee ceremony . Coffee ( Ge'ez ቡን būn ) is offered when visiting friends , during festivities , or as a daily staple of life . During the coffee ceremony , there are traditions that are upheld . The coffee is served in three rounds : the first brew or round is called awel in Tigrinya meaning first , the second round is called kalaay meaning second , and the third round is called bereka meaning " to be blessed " . If coffee is politely declined , then most likely tea ( " shai " ሻሂ shahee ) will instead be served .
In addition to such annual festivals like Calle Ocho Festival and Carnaval Miami , Miami is home to many entertainment venues , theaters , museums , parks and performing arts centers .

Midway proved to be the last great naval battle for two years . The United States used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships , planes , and trained aircrew . At the same time , Japan , lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy , a good aircrew training program , or adequate naval resources and commerce defense , fell further and further behind . In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific , seizing one island base after another . Not every Japanese stronghold had to be captured ; some , like Truk , Rabaul , and Formosa , were neutralized by air attack and bypassed . The goal was to get close to Japan itself , then launch massive strategic air attacks , improve the submarine blockade , and finally ( only if necessary ) execute an invasion .
In order to enlist Stalin 's support , Zhou and a Chinese delegation left for Moscow on 8 October , arriving there on 10 October at which point they flew to Stalin 's home at the Black Sea . There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov , Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov . Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition , but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union 's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations . In a subsequent meeting , Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis , and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace , and only after an undisclosed period of time . Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951 . Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful , as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu . Soviet shipments of matériel , when they did arrive , were limited to small quantities of trucks , grenades , machine guns , and the like .
The simplest known circadian clock is that of the prokaryotic cyanobacteria . Recent research has demonstrated that the circadian clock of Synechococcus elongatus can be reconstituted in vitro with just the three proteins ( KaiA , KaiB , KaiC ) of their central oscillator . This clock has been shown to sustain a 22-hour rhythm over several days upon the addition of ATP . Previous explanations of the prokaryotic circadian timekeeper were dependent upon a DNA transcription/translation feedback mechanism . [ citation needed ]
On December 13 , 2013 , Beyoncé unexpectedly released her eponymous fifth studio album on the iTunes Store without any prior announcement or promotion . The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart , giving Beyoncé her fifth consecutive number-one album in the US . This made her the first woman in the chart 's history to have her first five studio albums debut at number one . Beyoncé received critical acclaim and commercial success , selling one million digital copies worldwide in six days ; The New York Times noted the album 's unconventional , unexpected release as significant . Musically an electro-R & B album , it concerns darker themes previously unexplored in her work , such as " bulimia , postnatal depression [ and ] the fears and insecurities of marriage and motherhood " . The single " Drunk in Love " , featuring Jay Z , peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . In April 2014 , after much speculation in the weeks before , Beyoncé and Jay Z officially announced their On the Run Tour . It served as the couple 's first co-headlining stadium tour together . On August 24 , 2014 , she received the Video Vanguard Award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards . Knowles also took home three competitive awards : Best Video with a Social Message and Best Cinematography for " Pretty Hurts " , as well as best collaboration for " Drunk in Love " . In November , Forbes reported that Beyoncé was the top-earning woman in music for the second year in a row—earning $ 115 million in the year , more than double her earnings in 2013 . Beyoncé was reissued with new material in three forms : as an extended play , a box set , as well as a full platinum edition .
David Archuleta 's performance of John Lennon 's " Imagine " was considered by many as one of the best of the season . Jennifer Lopez , who was brought in as a judge in season ten , called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget . Jason Castro 's semi-final performance of " Hallelujah " also received considerable attention , and it propelled Jeff Buckley 's version of the song to the top of the Billboard digital song chart . This was the first season in which contestants ' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances , and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest , leaked information indicated that contestants ' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts .
A study published in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants , who wanted to drink more as a result . The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans , while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer , water and a sports drink onto their tongues . Compared with the taste of the sports drink , the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink . Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release , even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated .

By relying on the city sub-center , which is under construction , the South Park is focusing on creating a modernized industrial park of science and technology with scientific and technological innovation , incubation R & D , modern service industry and Headquarters economy playing leading roles . Priority has been given to the development of software industry . Located on both sides of the " Chengdu-Dujiangyan-Jiuzhaigou " golden tourism channel , the West Park aims at building a comprehensive industrial park targeting at industrial clustering with complete supportive functions . The West Park gives priority to three major industries i.e . electronic information , biomedicine and precision machinery .
Many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones . The " escape " character ( ESC , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning . This is the same meaning of " escape " encountered in URL encodings , C language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed . In modern use , an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence , usually in the form of a so-called " ANSI escape code " ( or , more properly , a " Control Sequence Introducer " ) beginning with ESC followed by a " [ " ( left-bracket ) character . An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an out-of-band character used to terminate an operation , as in the TECO and vi text editors . In graphical user interface ( GUI ) and windowing systems , ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether .
The total solar energy absorbed by Earth 's atmosphere , oceans and land masses is approximately 3,850,000 exajoules ( EJ ) per year . In 2002 , this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year . Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass . The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the planet is so vast that in one year it is about twice as much as will ever be obtained from all of the Earth 's non-renewable resources of coal , oil , natural gas , and mined uranium combined ,
Rapid decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself . Even if the victim does not hold his or her breath , venting through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the fatal rupture of the delicate alveoli of the lungs . Eardrums and sinuses may be ruptured by rapid decompression , soft tissues may bruise and seep blood , and the stress of shock will accelerate oxygen consumption leading to hypoxia . Injuries caused by rapid decompression are called barotrauma . A pressure drop of 13 kPa ( 100 Torr ) , which produces no symptoms if it is gradual , may be fatal if it occurs suddenly .
Before A.D. 200 , residents were building earthwork mounds , which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes . Succeeding peoples , including those of the ancient Mississippian culture established by A.D. 1000 in the Piedmont , continued to build or add onto such mounds . In the 500–700 years preceding European contact , the Mississippian culture built large , complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks . Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region included the Carolina Algonquian-speaking tribes of the coastal areas , such as the Chowanoke , Roanoke , Pamlico , Machapunga , Coree , Cape Fear Indians , and others , who were the first to encounter the English ; Iroquoian-speaking Meherrin , Cherokee and Tuscarora of the interior ; and Southeastern Siouan tribes , such as the Cheraw , Waxhaw , Saponi , Waccamaw , and Catawba .

Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings , such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard , which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other . Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer processing ( usually using Latin characters and the local script ) , but not multilingual computer processing ( computer processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other ) .
Starting in 2006 , Apple 's industrial design shifted to favor aluminum , which was used in the construction of the first MacBook Pro . Glass was added in 2008 with the introduction of the unibody MacBook Pro . These materials are billed as environmentally friendly . The iMac , MacBook Pro , MacBook Air , and Mac Mini lines currently all use aluminum enclosures , and are now made of a single unibody . Chief designer Jonathan Ive continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel , including eliminating of replaceable batteries in notebooks . Multi-touch gestures from the iPhone 's interface have been applied to the Mac line in the form of touch pads on notebooks and the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad for desktops .
There are eight Island Courts and Lands Courts ; appeals in relation to land disputes are made to the Lands Courts Appeal Panel . Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court , which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to $ T10,000 . The superior court is the High Court of Tuvalu as it has unlimited original jurisdiction to determine the Law of Tuvalu and to hear appeals from the lower courts . Sir Gordon Ward is the current Chief Justice of Tuvalu . Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu . From the Court of Appeal there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council , i.e. , the Privy Council in London .
Oklahoma holds eleven public regional universities , including Northeastern State University , the second-oldest institution of higher education west of the Mississippi River , also containing the only College of Optometry in Oklahoma and the largest enrollment of Native American students in the nation by percentage and amount . Langston University is Oklahoma 's only historically black college . Six of the state 's universities were placed in the Princeton Review 's list of best 122 regional colleges in 2007 , and three made the list of top colleges for best value . The state has 55 post-secondary technical institutions operated by Oklahoma 's CareerTech program for training in specific fields of industry or trade .
Slavery and slaves were part of the social order ; there were slave markets where they could be bought and sold . Many slaves were freed by the masters for services rendered ; some slaves could save money to buy their freedom . Generally , mutilation and murder of slaves was prohibited by legislation . However , Rome did not have a law enforcement arm . All actions were treated as " torts , " which were brought by an accuser who was forced to prove the entire case himself . If the accused were a noble and the victim , not a noble , the likelihood of finding for the accused was small . At most , the accused might have to pay a fine for killing a slave . It is estimated that over 25 % of the Roman population was enslaved .
For over 40 years , the FBI crime lab in Quantico believed lead in bullets had unique chemical signatures . It analyzed the bullets with the goal of matching them chemically , not only to a single batch of ammunition coming out of a factory , but also to a single box of bullets . The National Academy of Sciences conducted an 18-month independent review of comparative bullet-lead analysis . In 2003 , its National Research Council published a report whose conclusions called into question 30 years of FBI testimony . It found the analytic model used by the FBI for interpreting results was deeply flawed , and the conclusion , that bullet fragments could be matched to a box of ammunition , was so overstated that it was misleading under the rules of evidence . One year later , the FBI decided to stop doing bullet lead analysis .
Imperial 's main campus is located in the South Kensington area of central London . It is situated in an area of South Kensington , known as Albertopolis , which has a high concentration of cultural and academic institutions , adjacent to the Natural History Museum , the Science Museum , the Victoria and Albert Museum , the Royal College of Music , the Royal College of Art , the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Albert Hall . Nearby public attractions include the Kensington Palace , Hyde Park and the Kensington Gardens , the National Art Library , and the Brompton Oratory . The expansion of the South Kensington campus in the 1950s & 1960s absorbed the site of the former Imperial Institute , designed by Thomas Collcutt , of which only the 287 foot ( 87 m ) high Queen 's Tower remains among the more modern buildings .
Some of Chopin 's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles , such as the Revolutionary Étude ( Op . 10 , No . 12 ) , and the Minute Waltz ( Op . 64 , No . 1 ) . However , with the exception of his Funeral March , the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number , leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others . There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time . The Funeral March , the third movement of his Sonata No . 2 ( Op . 35 ) , the one case where he did give a title , was written before the rest of the sonata , but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it .
Traditionally , the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking refuge in the Three Jewels ( Sanskrit : tri-ratna , Pāli : ti-ratana ) [ web 19 ] as the foundation of one 's religious practice . The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the Majjhima Nikaya , recognized by most scholars as an early text ( cf . Infant baptism ) . Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge , in the lama . In Mahayana , the person who chooses the bodhisattva path makes a vow or pledge , considered the ultimate expression of compassion . In Mahayana , too , the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect : " The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence . Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness , whether praised or reviled , so are the Three Jewels ( Refuges ) , because they have an eternal and immutable essence . These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless , for once one has reached Buddhahood , there is no possibility of falling back to suffering .
Brass , which is an alloy of copper and zinc , has been used since at least the 10th century BC in Judea and by the 7th century BC in Ancient Greece . Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India and was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century . The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC . To date , the oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar , in Rajasthan , as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc . Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called " philosopher 's wool " or " white snow " .
London is home to many museums , galleries , and other institutions , many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role . The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury , in 1753 . Originally containing antiquities , natural history specimens and the national library , the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe . In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings ; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square .
Most fatty acids are non-essential , meaning the body can produce them as needed , generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so . However , in humans , at least two fatty acids are essential and must be included in the diet . An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health , although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive . Both of these " omega " long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins , which have roles throughout the human body . They are hormones , in some respects . The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , or taken in through marine food sources , serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins ( e.g. , weakly inflammatory PGE3 ) . The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DGLA ) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins ( e.g . anti-inflammatory PGE1 ) , whereas arachidonic acid ( AA ) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins ( e.g . pro-inflammatory PGE 2 ) . Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid ( LA ) in the human body , or can be taken in directly through food . An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins , which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health . In industrialized societies , people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils , which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids .
It is estimated that there are around 100 elephants left in Eritrea , the most northerly of East Africa 's elephants . The endangered African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) was previously found in Eritrea , but is now deemed extirpated from the entire country . In Gash Barka , deadly snakes like saw-scaled viper are common . Puff adder and red spitting cobra are widespread and can be found even in the highlands.In the coastal areas marine species that are common include dolphin , dugong , whale shark , turtles , marlin/swordfish , and manta ray .
In March 1861 , Victoria 's mother died , with Victoria at her side . Through reading her mother 's papers , Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply ; she was heart-broken , and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for " wickedly " estranging her from her mother . To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief , Albert took on most of her duties , despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble . In August , Victoria and Albert visited their son , the Prince of Wales , who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin , and spent a few days holidaying in Killarney . In November , Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland . Appalled , Albert travelled to Cambridge , where his son was studying , to confront him . By the beginning of December , Albert was very unwell . He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner , and died on 14 December 1861 . Victoria was devastated . She blamed her husband 's death on worry over the Prince of Wales 's philandering . He had been " killed by that dreadful business " , she said . She entered a state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life . She avoided public appearances , and rarely set foot in London in the following years . Her seclusion earned her the nickname " widow of Windsor " .
One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist C. Loring Brace 's observation that such variations , insofar as it is affected by natural selection , slow migration , or genetic drift , are distributed along geographic gradations or clines . In part this is due to isolation by distance . This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races ( for example , those based on hair texture and skin color ) : they ignore a host of other similarities and differences ( for example , blood type ) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race . Thus , anthropologist Frank Livingstone 's conclusion , that since clines cross racial boundaries , " there are no races , only clines " .
Throughout the history of the South Slavs , the vernacular , literary , and written languages ( e.g . Chakavian , Kajkavian , Shtokavian ) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently . Prior to the 19th century , they were collectively called " Illyric " , " Slavic " , " Slavonian " , " Bosnian " , " Dalmatian " , " Serbian " or " Croatian " . As such , the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824 , popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades , and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859 . At that time , Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires . Officially , the language was called variously Serbo-Croat , Croato-Serbian , Serbian and Croatian , Croatian and Serbian , Serbian or Croatian , Croatian or Serbian . Unofficially , Serbs and Croats typically called the language " Serbian " or " Croatian " , respectively , without implying a distinction between the two , and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina , " Bosnian " , " Croatian " , and " Serbian " were considered to be three names of a single official language . Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988 , claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European , Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language , but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits ( ‘ Bosnian ’ and ‘ Montenegrin ’ ) . Today , use of the term " Serbo-Croatian " is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match . It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative , though alternative names have been used , such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian ( BCS ) , which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal .
Victoria 's father was Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom , George III . Until 1817 , Edward 's niece , Princess Charlotte of Wales , was the only legitimate grandchild of George III . Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children . In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld , a widowed German princess with two children—Carl ( 1804–1856 ) and Feodora ( 1807–1872 ) —by her first marriage to the Prince of Leiningen . Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower . The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child , Victoria , was born at 4.15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London .
ReplayGain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file ( audio normalization ) in its metadata tag , enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file . MP3Gain may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability .
As a Republican , he was first elected on October 7 , 2003 , in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis . Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17 , to serve the remainder of Davis 's term . Schwarzenegger was then re-elected on November 7 , 2006 , in California 's 2006 gubernatorial election , to serve a full term as governor , defeating Democrat Phil Angelides , who was California State Treasurer at the time . Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5 , 2007 . In 2011 , Schwarzenegger completed his second term as governor .
On October 31 , 2013 , after outcry from media outlets , including heavy criticism from Nick Bilton of The New York Times , the FAA announced it will allow airlines to expand the passengers use of portable electronic devices during all phases of flight , but mobile phone calls will still be prohibited . Implementation will vary among airlines . The FAA expects many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode , gate-to-gate , by the end of 2013 . Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing . Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled , with no signal bars displayed , and can not be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones . If an air carrier provides Wi-Fi service during flight , passengers may use it . Short-range Bluetooth accessories , like wireless keyboards , can also be used .
In 2001 , she became the first African-American woman and second woman songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers Pop Music Awards . Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ( " Irreplaceable " , " Grillz " and " Check on It " ) in the same year , after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991 . She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles . ( The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song " I Was Here " for 4 . ) In May 2011 , Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the " Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters " , for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . She was one of only three women on that list .
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) from the half-way point .
Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals , and cross species hybrids are often possible . A familiar example is peppermint , Mentha × piperita , a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint , Mentha spicata . The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids . Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes . This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing . In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals . These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes .
The first road connecting the city to the mainland at Pleasantville was completed in 1870 and charged a 30-cent toll . Albany Avenue was the first road to the mainland that was available without a toll .
The Ottoman bashi-bazouks brutally suppressed the Bulgarian uprising of 1876 , massacring up to 100,000 people in the process . The Russo-Turkish War ( 1877–78 ) ended with a decisive victory for Russia . As a result , Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply ; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire , Romania achieved full independence . Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence , but with smaller territories . In 1878 , Austria-Hungary unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Novi Pazar .
In 1846 , the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California . At first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including San Diego , but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back . Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles , the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846 . Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24 , 1846 , when the Americans recaptured it . For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo . Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night . The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out . On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner 's Ranch . Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him . Their joint command of 150 men , returning to San Diego , encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico . In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual , fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego , the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign . Subsequently a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego , rescuing Kearny 's battered and blockaded command .
On 1 August , the British fleet under Horatio Nelson captured or destroyed all but two French vessels in the Battle of the Nile , defeating Bonaparte 's goal to strengthen the French position in the Mediterranean . His army had succeeded in a temporary increase of French power in Egypt , though it faced repeated uprisings . In early 1799 , he moved an army into the Ottoman province of Damascus ( Syria and Galilee ) . Bonaparte led these 13,000 French soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of Arish , Gaza , Jaffa , and Haifa . The attack on Jaffa was particularly brutal . Bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war , ostensibly on parole , so he ordered the garrison and 1,400 prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets . Men , women , and children were robbed and murdered for three days .
Genocide has become an official term used in international relations . The word genocide was not in use before 1944 . Before this , in 1941 , Winston Churchill described the mass killing of Russian prisoners of war and civilians as " a crime without a name " . In that year , a Polish-Jewish lawyer named Raphael Lemkin , described the policies of systematic murder founded by the Nazis as genocide . The word genocide is the combination of the Greek prefix geno- ( meaning tribe or race ) and caedere ( the Latin word for to kill ) . The word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them .
SVCD has two-thirds the resolution of DVD , and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD . One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard quality SVCD-format video . While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification , one must lower the video bit rate , and therefore quality , to accommodate very long videos . It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss , and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 kilobits per second .
Seen in panorama , Detroit 's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles . The post modern Neo-Gothic spires of the One Detroit Center ( 1993 ) were designed to blend with the city 's Art Deco skyscrapers . Together with the Renaissance Center , they form a distinctive and recognizable skyline . Examples of the Art Deco style include the Guardian Building and Penobscot Building downtown , as well as the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place in the New Center area near Wayne State University . Among the city 's prominent structures are United States ' largest Fox Theatre , the Detroit Opera House , and the Detroit Institute of Arts .
GE ( General Electric ) Energy 's renewable energy business has expanded greatly , to keep up with growing U.S. and global demand for clean energy . Since entering the renewable energy industry in 2002 , GE has invested more than $ 850 million in renewable energy commercialization . In August 2008 it acquired Kelman Ltd , a Northern Ireland company specializing in advanced monitoring and diagnostics technologies for transformers used in renewable energy generation , and announced an expansion of its business in Northern Ireland in May 2010 . In 2009 , GE 's renewable energy initiatives , which include solar power , wind power and GE Jenbacher gas engines using renewable and non-renewable methane-based gases , employ more than 4,900 people globally and have created more than 10,000 supporting jobs .
Equivalently , the smallness of the Planck constant reflects the fact that everyday objects and systems are made of a large number of particles . For example , green light with a wavelength of 555 nanometres ( the approximate wavelength to which human eyes are most sensitive ) has a frequency of 7014540000000000000♠540 THz ( 7014540000000000000♠540×1012 Hz ) . Each photon has an energy E = hf = 6981358000000000000♠3.58×10−19 J . That is a very small amount of energy in terms of everyday experience , but everyday experience is not concerned with individual photons any more than with individual atoms or molecules . An amount of light compatible with everyday experience is the energy of one mole of photons ; its energy can be computed by multiplying the photon energy by the Avogadro constant , NA ≈ 7023602200000000000♠6.022×1023 mol−1 . The result is that green light of wavelength 555 nm has an energy of 7005216000000000000♠216 kJ/mol , a typical energy of everyday life .
Other religions that form a small percentage are Buddhism and Sikhism . The Lahaulis of Lahaul and Spiti region are mainly Buddhists . Sikhs mostly live in towns and cities and constitute 1.16 % of the state population . For example , they form 10 % of the population in Una District adjoining the state of Punjab and 17 % in Shimla , the state capital . The Buddhists constitute 1.15 % are mainly natives and tribals from Lahaul and Spiti , where they form majority of 60 % and Kinnaur where they form 40 % , however the bulk are refugees from Tibet . The Muslims constitute slightly 2.18 % of the population of Himachal Pradesh .
UCLA professor Richard H. Sander published an article in the November 2004 issue of the Stanford Law Review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools . He noted that , prior to his article , there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action . The article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam . The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended . Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better . Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996 , which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California . This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41 % , compared to 73 % for whites .
World War I demonstrated that aircraft could be an important part of the battlefield , but in some nations it was the prospect of strategic air attack that was the main issue , presenting both a threat and an opportunity . The experience of four years of air attacks on London by Zeppelins and Gotha G.V bombers had particularly influenced the British and was one of if not the main driver for forming an independent air force . As the capabilities of aircraft and their engines improved it was clear that their role in future war would be even more critical as their range and weapon load grew . However , in the years immediately after World War I the prospect of another major war seemed remote , particularly in Europe where the most militarily capable nations were , and little financing was available .
The island was administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614 . Its spin-off , the Somers Isles Company , took over in 1615 and managed the colony until 1684 . At that time , the company 's charter was revoked , and the English Crown took over administration . The islands became a British colony following the 1707 unification of the parliaments of Scotland and England , which created the Kingdom of Great Britain . After 1949 , when Newfoundland became part of Canada , Bermuda was automatically ranked as the oldest remaining British Overseas Territory . Since the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 , it is the most populous Territory . Its first capital , St. George 's , was established in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the New World .
Daniel Gralath was the first to combine several jars in parallel into a " battery " to increase the charge storage capacity . Benjamin Franklin investigated the Leyden jar and came to the conclusion that the charge was stored on the glass , not in the water as others had assumed . He also adopted the term " battery " , ( denoting the increasing of power with a row of similar units as in a battery of cannon ) , subsequently applied to clusters of electrochemical cells . Leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil , leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the foils . [ citation needed ] The earliest unit of capacitance was the jar , equivalent to about 1.11 nanofarads .
Investitures , which include the conferring of knighthoods by dubbing with a sword , and other awards take place in the palace 's Ballroom , built in 1854 . At 36.6 m ( 120 ft ) long , 18 m ( 59 ft ) wide and 13.5 m ( 44 ft ) high , it is the largest room in the palace . It has replaced the throne room in importance and use . During investitures , the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant , domed velvet canopy , known as a shamiana or a baldachin , that was used at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 . A military band plays in the musicians ' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their honours , watched by their families and friends .
LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits . The forward voltage drop ( e.g . about 1.7 V for a normal red LED ) can be used instead of a Zener diode in low-voltage regulators . Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee . Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose . Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode , Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available .
Electricity in the Richmond Metro area is provided by Dominion Virginia Power . The company , based in Richmond , is one of the nation 's largest producers of energy , serving retail energy customers in nine states . Electricity is provided in the Richmond area primarily by the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station and Surry Nuclear Generating Station , as well as a coal-fired station in Chester , Virginia . These three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power . Several other natural gas plants provide extra power during times of peak demand . These include facilities in Chester , and Surry , and two plants in Richmond ( Gravel Neck and Darbytown ) .
Notably , a statute does not disappear automatically merely because it has been found unconstitutional ; it must be deleted by a subsequent statute . Many federal and state statutes have remained on the books for decades after they were ruled to be unconstitutional . However , under the principle of stare decisis , no sensible lower court will enforce an unconstitutional statute , and any court that does so will be reversed by the Supreme Court . Conversely , any court that refuses to enforce a constitutional statute ( where such constitutionality has been expressly established in prior cases ) will risk reversal by the Supreme Court .
The Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the subcontinent under the leadership of their first emperor , Kujula Kadphises , about the middle of the 1st century CE . They came of an Indo-European language speaking Central Asian tribe called the Yuezhi , a branch of which was known as the Kushans . By the time of his grandson , Kanishka , they had conquered most of northern India , at least as far as Saketa and Pataliputra , in the middle Ganges Valley , and probably as far as the Bay of Bengal .
DNA replication is for the most part extremely accurate , however errors ( mutations ) do occur . :7.6 The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication , whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3 . This means that each generation , each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations . Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted . Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense ( change a codon to encode a different amino acid ) or nonsense ( a premature stop codon ) . Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication , deletion , rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome . Additionally , the DNA repair mechanisms that normally revert mutations can introduce errors when repairing the physical damage to the molecule is more important than restoring an exact copy , for example when repairing double-strand breaks . :5.4
By 1200 , the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy , Zähringer , Habsburg , and Kyburg . Some regions ( Uri , Schwyz , Unterwalden , later known as Waldstätten ) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes . With the extinction of its male line in 1263 the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264 ; then the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I ( Holy Roman Emperor in 1273 ) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau .

The municipalities have two major policy responsibilities . First , they administer programs authorized by the federal or state government . Such programs typically relate to youth , schools , public health , and social assistance . Second , Article 28 ( 2 ) of the Basic Law guarantees the municipalities " the right to regulate on their own responsibility all the affairs of the local community within the limits set by law . " Under this broad statement of competence , local governments can justify a wide range of activities . For instance , many municipalities develop and expand the economic infrastructure of their communities through the development of industrial trading estates .
In 1803 , an Act of Parliament , promoted by the East India Company , established the East India Dock Company , with the aim of establishing a new set of docks ( the East India Docks ) primarily for the use of ships trading with India . The existing Brunswick Dock , part of the Blackwall Yard site , became the Export Dock ; while a new Import Dock was built to the north . In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company . The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909 , and closed in 1967 .
The team worked on a Wii control scheme , adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface . A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first-person viewpoint , but was unable to show the variety of Link 's movements . When the third-person view was restored , Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link 's left hand , so the entire Wii version map was mirrored . [ p ] Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution , it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller . Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller-functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after . However , support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release . At E3 2006 , Nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the Wii launch , and had a playable version of Twilight Princess for the Wii . [ p ] Later , the GameCube release was pushed back to a month after the launch of the Wii .
After the U.S. accused Libya of orchestrating the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing , in which two American soldiers died , Reagan decided to retaliate militarily . The Central Intelligence Agency were critical of the move , believing that Syria were a greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi 's reputation ; however Libya was recognised as a " soft target . " Reagan was supported by the U.K. but opposed by other European allies , who argued that it would contravene international law . In Operation El Dorado Canyon , orchestrated on 15 April 1986 , U.S. military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya , bombing military installations in various parts of the country , killing around 100 Libyans , including several civilians . One of the targets had been Gaddafi 's home . Himself unharmed , two of Gaddafi 's sons were injured , and he claimed that his four-year-old adopted daughter Hanna was killed , although her existence has since been questioned . In the immediate aftermath , Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate , while there were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government . Although the U.S. was condemned internationally , Reagan received a popularity boost at home . Publicly lambasting U.S. imperialism , Gaddafi 's reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened both domestically and across the Arab world , and in June 1986 , he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya .
Under the millet system , non-Muslim people were considered subjects of the Empire , but were not subject to the Muslim faith or Muslim law . The Orthodox millet , for instance , was still officially legally subject to Justinian 's Code , which had been in effect in the Byzantine Empire for 900 years . Also , as the largest group of non-Muslim subjects ( or zimmi ) of the Islamic Ottoman state , the Orthodox millet was granted a number of special privileges in the fields of politics and commerce , and had to pay higher taxes than Muslim subjects .
Jantar Mantar located in Connaught Place was built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur . It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments . The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables , and to predict the times and movements of the sun , moon and planets .
During the Later Middle Ages , theologians such as John Duns Scotus ( d. 1308 ) [ AH ] and William of Ockham ( d. c. 1348 ) , led a reaction against scholasticism , objecting to the application of reason to faith . Their efforts undermined the prevailing Platonic idea of " universals " . Ockham 's insistence that reason operates independently of faith allowed science to be separated from theology and philosophy . Legal studies were marked by the steady advance of Roman law into areas of jurisprudence previously governed by customary law . The lone exception to this trend was in England , where the common law remained pre-eminent . Other countries codified their laws ; legal codes were promulgated in Castile , Poland , and Lithuania .
St. John 's ( /ˌseɪntˈdʒɒnz/ , local /ˌseɪntˈdʒɑːnz/ ) is the capital and largest city in Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada . St. John 's was incorporated as a city in 1888 , yet is considered by some to be the oldest English-founded city in North America . It is located on the eastern tip of the Avalon Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland . With a population of 214,285 as of July 1 , 2015 , the St. John 's Metropolitan Area is the second largest Census Metropolitan Area ( CMA ) in Atlantic Canada after Halifax and the 20th largest metropolitan area in Canada . It is one of the world 's top ten oceanside destinations , according to National Geographic Magazine . Its name has been attributed to the feast day of John the Baptist , when John Cabot was believed to have sailed into the harbour in 1497 , and also to a Basque fishing town with the same name .
Red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species . For example , in mandrills , red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males , increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates , and directly correlated with levels of testosterone . Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others , leading to significant differences in mortality , reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not . In humans , wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions , including professional sport and multiplayer video games . Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise , so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance . Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue , and , when asked , a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more " dominant " , " aggressive " , and " likely to win a physical competition " than blue shapes . In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior , exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an " achievement " context ( e.g . taking an IQ test ) .
The Marshall Islands , officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( Marshallese : Aolepān Aorōkin M̧ajeļ ) , [ note 1 ] is an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean , slightly west of the International Date Line . Geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia . The country 's population of 53,158 people ( at the 2011 Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . The islands share maritime boundaries with the Federated States of Micronesia to the west , Wake Island to the north , [ note 2 ] Kiribati to the south-east , and Nauru to the south . About 27,797 of the islanders ( at the 2011 Census ) live on Majuro , which contains the capital .
Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel , and called for its destruction . By 1966 , Israeli-Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces . In May 1967 , Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel , expelled UN peacekeepers , stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957 , and blocked Israel 's access to the Red Sea [ citation needed ] . Other Arab states mobilized their forces . Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli . On 5 June 1967 , Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against Egypt . Jordan , Syria and Iraq responded and attacked Israel . In a Six-Day War , Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank , defeated Egypt and captured the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula , and defeated Syria and captured the Golan Heights . Jerusalem 's boundaries were enlarged , incorporating East Jerusalem , and the 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories .
The American Revolution begun with fighting at Lexington and Concord . On July 4 , 1776 , they issued the Declaration of Independence , which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union . In June 1776 , Benjamin Franklin was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence . Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee , Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson .
Marwan was succeeded by his son , Abd al-Malik ( 685–705 ) , who reconsolidated Umayyad control of the caliphate . The early reign of Abd al-Malik was marked by the revolt of Al-Mukhtar , which was based in Kufa . Al-Mukhtar hoped to elevate Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah , another son of Ali , to the caliphate , although Ibn al-Hanafiyyah himself may have had no connection to the revolt . The troops of al-Mukhtar engaged in battles both with the Umayyads in 686 , defeating them at the river Khazir near Mosul , and with Ibn al-Zubayr in 687 , at which time the revolt of al-Mukhtar was crushed . In 691 , Umayyad troops reconquered Iraq , and in 692 the same army captured Mecca . Ibn al-Zubayr was killed in the attack .
Zen Buddhism ( 禅 ) , pronounced Chán in Chinese , seon in Korean or zen in Japanese ( derived from the Sanskrit term dhyāna , meaning " meditation " ) is a form of Buddhism that became popular in China , Korea and Japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation . [ note 12 ] Zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of Buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth .
Roman government was headed by two consuls , elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates . As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards , the evolution of the Roman government was heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians , Rome 's land-holding aristocracy , who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome , and the plebeians , the far more numerous citizen-commoners . Over time , the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome 's highest offices were repealed or weakened , and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy . The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war , making military and political success inextricably linked . Many of Rome 's legal and legislative structures ( later codified into the Justinian Code , and again into the Napoleonic Code ) can still be observed throughout Europe and much of the world in modern nation states and international organizations .

Southampton has always been a port , and the docks have long been a major employer in the city . In particular , it is a port for cruise ships ; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century , and in particular the inter-war years , when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK . Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships , as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage , with several container terminals . Unlike some other ports , such as Liverpool , London , and Bristol , where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment , Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry . Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre , further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009 , parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped ; the Ocean Village development , which included a local marina and small entertainment complex , is a good example . Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator Carnival UK .
In 2002 , Elizabeth marked her Golden Jubilee . Her sister and mother died in February and March respectively , and the media speculated whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure . She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms , which began in Jamaica in February , where she called the farewell banquet " memorable " after a power cut plunged the King 's House , the official residence of the governor-general , into darkness . As in 1977 , there were street parties and commemorative events , and monuments were named to honour the occasion . A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London , and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the Queen was greater than many journalists had expected .
José Manuel González-Páramo , a Spanish member of the Executive Board since June 2004 , was due to leave the board in early June 2012 and no replacement had been named as of late May 2012 . The Spanish had nominated Barcelona-born Antonio Sáinz de Vicuña , an ECB veteran who heads its legal department , as González-Páramo 's replacement as early as January 2012 but alternatives from Luxembourg , Finland , and Slovenia were put forward and no decision made by May . After a long political battle , Luxembourg 's Yves Mersch , was appointed as González-Páramo 's replacement .

HHC 's MetroPlus Health Plan is one of the New York area 's largest providers of government-sponsored health insurance and is the plan of choice for nearly half million New Yorkers .
Stephen Hawking in particular has addressed a connection between time and the Big Bang . In A Brief History of Time and elsewhere , Hawking says that even if time did not begin with the Big Bang and there were another time frame before the Big Bang , no information from events then would be accessible to us , and nothing that happened then would have any effect upon the present time-frame . Upon occasion , Hawking has stated that time actually began with the Big Bang , and that questions about what happened before the Big Bang are meaningless . This less-nuanced , but commonly repeated formulation has received criticisms from philosophers such as Aristotelian philosopher Mortimer J. Adler .
The Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for planning , implementation and monitoring of all facilities related to health and preventive services . As of 2010 [ update ] –11 , the city had 50 government hospitals , 300 private and charity hospitals and 194 nursing homes providing around 12,000 hospital beds , fewer than half the required 25,000 .

Cask-conditioned ales ( or cask ales ) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers . These beers are termed " real ale " by the CAMRA organisation . Typically , when a cask arrives in a pub , it is placed horizontally on a frame called a " stillage " which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle , and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature ( typically between 11–13 °C or 52–55 °F ) , before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a ( usually rubber ) bung at the bottom of one end , and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask , which is now uppermost . The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment , so it must be left for a suitable period to " drop " ( clear ) again , as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days . At this point the beer is ready to sell , either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump , or simply being " gravity-fed " directly into the glass .
Meanwhile , the Tumed Mongols began moving into the Kokonor region ( modern Qinghai ) , raiding the Ming Chinese frontier and even as far as the suburbs of Beijing under Altan Khan ( 1507–1582 ) . Klieger writes that Altan Khan 's presence in the west effectively reduced Ming influence and contact with Tibet . After Altan Khan made peace with the Ming dynasty in 1571 , he invited the third hierarch of the Gelug—Sönam Gyatso ( 1543–1588 ) —to meet him in Amdo ( modern Qinghai ) in 1578 , where he accidentally bestowed him and his two predecessors with the title of Dalai Lama— " Ocean Teacher " . The full title was " Dalai Lama Vajradhara " , " Vajradhara " meaning " Holder of the Thunderbolt " in Sanskrit . Victoria Huckenpahler notes that Vajradhara is considered by Buddhists to be the primordial Buddha of limitless and all-pervasive beneficial qualities , a being that " represents the ultimate aspect of enlightenment . " Goldstein writes that Sönam Gyatso also enhanced Altan Khan 's standing by granting him the title " king of religion , majestic purity " . Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama officially recognized Altan Khan as the " Protector of the Faith " .
UNFPA provided aid to Peru 's reproductive health program in the mid-to-late '90s . When it was discovered a Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations , UNFPA called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance . UNFPA was not involved in the scandal , but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices .
The elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft . Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise ; backwards would make it sink . The harder the pressure , the faster the elevator would move . The handle also served as a dead man switch : if the operator let go of the handle , it would return to its upright position , causing the elevator cab to stop . In time , safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move .

PC World says that iPod line has " altered the landscape for portable audio players " . Several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the iPod line and the AAC audio format . Examples include CD copy-protection schemes , and mobile phones , such as phones from Sony Ericsson and Nokia , which play AAC files rather than WMA .
Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence . The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia , which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BCE with 6,000 inhabitants . Massalia was also the local hegemon , controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde . The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Ligurian-Celtic Gaul . Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs , and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins , especially those of Southern France . Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône , and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul , and to Switzerland and Burgundy . The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia ( 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE ) and according to Strabo , Massalia was also a center of education , where Celts went to learn Greek . A staunch ally of Rome , Massalia retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BCE and was then taken by Caesar 's forces .
In 1830 , the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills , stopping at towns and great country houses along the way . Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832 , 1833 , 1834 and 1835 . To the King 's annoyance , Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops . William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heiress presumptive . Victoria disliked the trips ; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill , and there was little time for her to rest . She objected on the grounds of the King 's disapproval , but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy , and forced Victoria to continue the tours . At Ramsgate in October 1835 , Victoria contracted a severe fever , which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence . While Victoria was ill , Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary . As a teenager , Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff . Once queen , she banned him from her presence , but he remained in her mother 's household .
The port of Palermo , founded by the Phoenicians over 2,700 years ago , is , together with the port of Messina , the main port of Sicily . From here ferries link Palermo to Cagliari , Genoa , Livorno , Naples , Tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually . It is also an important port for cruise ships . Traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes of cargo and 80.000 TEU yearly . The port also has links to minor sicilian islands such as Ustica and the Aeolian Islands ( via Cefalù in summer ) . Inside the Port of Palermo there is a section known as " tourist marina " for sailing yachts and catamarans .
Much of the music recorded by singer-songwriters such as Diana Ross , James Taylor , Carly Simon , Carole King and Janis Ian got as much , if not more , airplay on this format than on Top 40 stations . Easy Listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres , such as rock and roll or R & B . In addition , several early disco songs , did well on the Adult Contemporary format .
On 27 August 2007 , Royal Dutch Shell and Reitan Group , the owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia , announced an agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway , Sweden , Finland and Denmark , subject to obtaining regulatory approvals under the different competition laws in each country . On April 2010 Shell announced that the corporation is in process of trying to find a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and is doing similar market research concerning Swedish operations . On October 2010 Shell 's gas stations and the heavy vehicle fuel supply networks in Finland and Sweden , along with a refinery located in Gothenburg , Sweden were sold to St1 , a Finnish energy company , more precisely to its major shareholding parent company Keele Oy . Shell branded gas stations will be rebranded within maximum of five years from the acquisition and the number of gas stations is likely to be reduced . Until then the stations will operate under Shell brand licence .
In addition , there are a number of dialect characters ( 方言字 ) that are not used in formal written Chinese but represent colloquial terms in non-Mandarin varieties of Chinese . One such variety is Written Cantonese , in widespread use in Hong Kong even for certain formal documents , due to the former British colonial administration 's recognition of Cantonese for use for official purposes . In Taiwan , there is also an informal body of characters used to represent Hokkien Chinese . Many varieties have specific characters for words exclusive to them . For example , the vernacular character 㓾 , pronounced cii11 in Hakka , means " to kill " . Furthermore , Shanghainese and Sichuanese also have their own series of written text , but these are not widely used in actual texts , Mandarin being the preference for all mainland regions .
In an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots , Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768 . Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created . This was rejected by Napoleon , who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen . Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army 's rear . The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France 's retreat .
Today , the system of Arabic and Islamic education has grown and further integrated with Kerala government administration . In 2005 , an estimated 6,000 Muslim Arabic teachers taught in Kerala government schools , with over 500,000 Muslim students . State-appointed committees , not private mosques or religious scholars outside the government , determine the curriculum and accreditation of new schools and colleges . Primary education in Arabic and Islamic studies is available to Kerala Muslims almost entirely in after-school madrasa programs - sharply unlike full-time madaris common in north India , which may replace formal schooling . Arabic colleges ( over eleven of which exist within the state-run University of Calicut and the Kannur University ) provide B.A . and Masters ' level degrees . At all levels , instruction is co-educational , with many women instructors and professors . Islamic education boards are independently run by the following organizations , accredited by the Kerala state government : Samastha Kerala Islamic Education Board , Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen , Jamaat-e-Islami Hind , and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind .

Education in Switzerland is very diverse because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system to the cantons . There are both public and private schools , including many private international schools . The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons , but most cantons provide a free " children 's school " starting at four or five years old . Primary school continues until grade four , five or six , depending on the school . Traditionally , the first foreign language in school was always one of the other national languages , although recently ( 2000 ) English was introduced first in a few cantons .
Saint Helena has the international calling code +290 which , since 2006 , Tristan da Cunha shares . Saint Helena telephone numbers changed from 4 to 5 digits on 1 October 2013 by being prefixed with the digit " 2 " , i.e . 2xxxx , with the range 5xxxx being reserved for mobile numbering , and 8xxx being used for Tristan da Cunha numbers ( these still shown as 4 digits ) .
Commercially cultivated grapes can usually be classified as either table or wine grapes , based on their intended method of consumption : eaten raw ( table grapes ) or used to make wine ( wine grapes ) . While almost all of them belong to the same species , Vitis vinifera , table and wine grapes have significant differences , brought about through selective breeding . Table grape cultivars tend to have large , seedless fruit ( see below ) with relatively thin skin . Wine grapes are smaller , usually seeded , and have relatively thick skins ( a desirable characteristic in winemaking , since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin ) . Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet : they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24 % sugar by weight . By comparison , commercially produced " 100 % grape juice " , made from table grapes , is usually around 15 % sugar by weight .
New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from every important time period and architectural style in American history . The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms that have left their mark on the city including Ithiel Town and Henry Austin in the 19th century and Cesar Pelli , Warren Platner , Kevin Roche , Herbert Newman and Barry Svigals in the 20th . The Yale School of Architecture has fostered this important component of the city 's economy . Cass Gilbert , of the Beaux-Arts school , designed New Haven 's Union Station and the New Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a City Beautiful plan in 1919 . Frank Lloyd Wright , Marcel Breuer , Alexander Jackson Davis , Philip C. Johnson , Gordon Bunshaft , Louis Kahn , James Gamble Rogers , Frank Gehry , Charles Willard Moore , Stefan Behnisch , James Polshek , Paul Rudolph , Eero Saarinen and Robert Venturi all have designed buildings in New Haven . Yale 's 1950s-era Ingalls Rink , designed by Eero Saarinen , was included on the America 's Favorite Architecture list created in 2007 .
Cultural practices in the Americas seem to have been shared mostly within geographical zones where unrelated peoples adopted similar technologies and social organizations . An example of such a cultural area is Mesoamerica , where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns . Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of nomadic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting .
On June 28 , 1776 , General Sir Henry Clinton along with 2,000 men and a naval squadron tried to seize Charles Towne , hoping for a simultaneous Loyalist uprising in South Carolina . When the fleet fired cannonballs , they failed to penetrate Fort Sullivan 's unfinished , yet thick , palmetto-log walls . No local Loyalists attacked the town from the mainland side , as the British had hoped they would do . Col. Moultrie 's men returned fire and inflicted heavy damage on several of the British ships . The British were forced to withdraw their forces , and the Americans renamed the defensive installation as Fort Moultrie in honor of its commander .
Life with My Sister Madonna , a book by Madonna 's brother Christopher , debuted at number two on The New York Times bestseller list . The book caused some friction between Madonna and her brother , because of the unsolicited publication . Problems also arose between Madonna and Ritchie , with the media reporting that they were on the verge of separation . Ultimately , Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie , citing irreconcilable differences , which was finalized in December 2008 . She decided to adopt from Malawi . The country 's High Court initially approved the adoption of Chifundo " Mercy " James ; however , the application was rejected because Madonna was not a resident of the country . Madonna appealed , and on June 12 , 2009 , the Supreme Court of Malawi granted Madonna the right to adopt Mercy James . She also released Celebration , her third greatest-hits album and final release with Warner . It contained the new songs " Celebration " and " Revolver " along with 34 hits spanning her career . Celebration reached number one in the UK , tying her with Elvis Presley as the solo act with most number one albums in the British chart history . She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13 , 2009 , to speak in tribute to deceased pop star Michael Jackson .
The calendar was a refinement to the Julian calendar amounting to a 0.002 % correction in the length of the year . The motivation for the reform was to bring the date for the celebration of Easter to the time of the year in which it was celebrated when it was introduced by the early Church . Because the celebration of Easter was tied to the spring equinox , the Roman Catholic Church considered the steady drift in the date of Easter caused by the year being slightly too long to be undesirable . The reform was adopted initially by the Catholic countries of Europe . Protestants and Eastern Orthodox countries continued to use the traditional Julian calendar and adopted the Gregorian reform after a time , for the sake of convenience in international trade . The last European country to adopt the reform was Greece , in 1923 .
At the time the store was introduced , purchased audio files used the AAC format with added encryption , based on the FairPlay DRM system . Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files . Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD , then re-importing would create music files without the DRM . The DRM could also be removed using third-party software . However , in a deal with Apple , EMI began selling DRM-free , higher-quality songs on the iTunes Stores , in a category called " iTunes Plus . " While individual songs were made available at a cost of US $ 1.29 , 30¢ more than the cost of a regular DRM song , entire albums were available for the same price , US $ 9.99 , as DRM encoded albums . On October 17 , 2007 , Apple lowered the cost of individual iTunes Plus songs to US $ 0.99 per song , the same as DRM encoded tracks . On January 6 , 2009 , Apple announced that DRM has been removed from 80 % of the music catalog , and that it would be removed from all music by April 2009 .
These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party , led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke 's friendship with Fox . In debate in Parliament on Britain 's relations with Russia , Fox praised the principles of the revolution , although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was " overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House " . When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada , Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke 's arguments , such as hereditary power . On 6 May 1791 , during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill , Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox , and to condemn the new French Constitution and " the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man " . Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions . Burke was interrupted , and Fox intervened , saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech . A vote of censure was moved against Burke , however , for noticing the affairs of France , which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox . Pitt made a speech praising Burke , and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke . He questioned the sincerity of Burke , who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him , quoting from Burke 's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before .
The Wine and Beerhouse Act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century . The sale of beers , wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local magistrates . Further provisions regulated gaming , drunkenness , prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises , enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence . Licences were only granted , transferred or renewed at special Licensing Sessions courts , and were limited to respectable individuals . Often these were ex-servicemen or ex-policemen ; retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service . Licence conditions varied widely , according to local practice . They would specify permitted hours , which might require Sunday closing , or conversely permit all-night opening near a market . Typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours , and the provision of food or lavatories . Once obtained , licences were jealously protected by the licensees ( who were expected to be generally present , not an absentee owner or company ) , and even " Occasional Licences " to serve drinks at temporary premises such as fêtes would usually be granted only to existing licensees . Objections might be made by the police , rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks , disorderly or dirty premises , or ignoring permitted hours .
Perhaps due to the many modern negative connotations associated with the term heretic , such as the Spanish inquisition , the term is used less often today . The subject of Christian heresy opens up broader questions as to who has a monopoly on spiritual truth , as explored by Jorge Luis Borges in the short story " The Theologians " within the compilation Labyrinths .
The battle in the Marshall Islands caused irreparable damage , especially on Japanese bases . During the American bombing , the islands ' population suffered from lack of food and various injuries . U.S. attacks started in mid-1943 , and caused half the Japanese garrison of 5,100 people in the atoll Mili to die from hunger by August 1945 .
At the start of her reign Victoria was popular , but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother 's ladies-in-waiting , Lady Flora Hastings , developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy . Victoria believed the rumours . She hated Conroy , and despised " that odious Lady Flora " , because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System . At first , Lady Flora refused to submit to a naked medical examination , until in mid-February she eventually agreed , and was found to be a virgin . Conroy , the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised a press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora . When Lady Flora died in July , the post-mortem revealed a large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen . At public appearances , Victoria was hissed and jeered as " Mrs. Melbourne " .
Martin Luther , a German monk , started the German Reformation by posting 95 theses on the castle church of Wittenberg on October 31 , 1517 . The immediate provocation spurring this act was Pope Leo X ’ s renewal of the indulgence for the building of the new St. Peter 's Basilica in 1514 . Luther was challenged to recant his heresy at the Diet of Worms in 1521 . When he refused , he was placed under the ban of the Empire by Charles V. Receiving the protection of Frederick the Wise , he was then able to translate the Bible into German .
However , it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes , much of contemporary American common law has diverged significantly from English common law . The reason is that although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other 's rulings , American courts rarely follow post-Revolution Commonwealth rulings unless there is no American ruling on point , the facts and law at issue are nearly identical , and the reasoning is strongly persuasive .
Many names for pubs that appear nonsensical may have come from corruptions of old slogans or phrases , such as " The Bag o'Nails " ( Bacchanals ) , " The Goat and Compasses " ( God Encompasseth Us ) , " The Cat and the Fiddle " ( Chaton Fidèle : Faithful Kitten ) and " The Bull and Bush " , which purportedly celebrates the victory of Henry VIII at " Boulogne Bouche " or Boulogne-sur-Mer Harbour .
Vinson Massif , the highest peak in Antarctica at 4,892 m ( 16,050 ft ) , is located in the Ellsworth Mountains . Antarctica contains many other mountains , on both the main continent and the surrounding islands . Mount Erebus on Ross Island is the world 's southernmost active volcano . Another well-known volcano is found on Deception Island , which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970 . Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years . Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active . In 2004 , a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers .
In the U.S. , copyright infringement is sometimes confronted via lawsuits in civil court , against alleged infringers directly , or against providers of services and software that support unauthorized copying . For example , major motion-picture corporation MGM Studios filed suit against P2P file-sharing services Grokster and Streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement . In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled in favor of MGM , holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and , indeed , willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies . The MGM v. Grokster case did not overturn the earlier Sony decision , but rather clouded the legal waters ; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned .
The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails . However , throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized , at times as high as 14 nails . These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion . In the Western Church , before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted , with the feet side by side . After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails , with one foot placed on the other . Nails are almost always depicted in art , although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross . The tradition also carries to Christian emblems , e.g . the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion .
In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM cache memories , which are slower than registers but faster than main memory . Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically , often without the need for any intervention on the programmer 's part .
Early civilisations in Myanmar included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Burma and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Burma . In the 9th century , the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley and , following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s , the Burmese language , culture and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country . The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the Mongol invasions and several warring states emerged . In the 16th century , reunified by the Taungoo Dynasty , the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia . The early 19th century Konbaung Dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well . The British conquered Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century and the country became a British colony . Myanmar became an independent nation in 1948 , initially as a democratic nation and then , following a coup d'état in 1962 , a military dictatorship .
Terry Neill was recruited by the Arsenal board to replace Bertie Mee on 9 July 1976 and at the age of 34 he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date . With new signings like Malcolm Macdonald and Pat Jennings , and a crop of talent in the side such as Liam Brady and Frank Stapleton , the club enjoyed their best form since the 1971 double , reaching a trio of FA Cup finals ( 1978 , 1979 and 1980 ) , and losing the 1980 European Cup Winners ' Cup Final on penalties . The club 's only success during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final , widely regarded as a classic .
On the French side , planning after the disaster at Wissembourg had become essential . General Le Bœuf , flushed with anger , was intent upon going on the offensive over the Saar and countering their loss . However , planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride , as Intendant General Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible . Therefore , the armies of France would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible attack point , but also left the armies unable to support each other .
During the 19th century , it was not infrequent for the Foreign Office to approach The Times and ask for continental intelligence , which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources . [ citation needed ]
Community Training Centres ( CTCs ) have been established within the primary schools on each atoll . The CTCs provide vocational training to students who do not progress beyond Class 8 because they failed the entry qualifications for secondary education . The CTCs offer training in basic carpentry , gardening and farming , sewing and cooking . At the end of their studies the graduates can apply to continue studies either at Motufoua Secondary School or the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute ( TMTI ) . Adults can also attend courses at the CTCs .
Brazilian census data ( PNAD , 1999 ) indicate that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs . They were joined by 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds . Due to the raised age restriction of 14 , at least half of the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws . Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour , there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil . Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs , guns , and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence . This type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs . Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers , there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country .
These products include glued laminated timber ( glulam ) , wood structural panels ( including plywood , oriented strand board and composite panels ) , laminated veneer lumber ( LVL ) and other structural composite lumber ( SCL ) products , parallel strand lumber , and I-joists . Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991 . The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood .
Fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour , West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas . To this end , West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production , utilized slower tempos , and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s . In addition to U2 , West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression . To make his next effort , the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums , more introspective and personal in lyricism , West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability .
During the Gorbachev era of the 1980s , with the reforms of Glasnost and Perestroika , Armenians began to demand better environmental care for their country , opposing the pollution that Soviet-built factories brought . Tensions also developed between Soviet Azerbaijan and its autonomous district of Nagorno-Karabakh , a majority-Armenian region separated by Stalin from Armenia in 1923 . About 484,000 Armenians lived in Azerbaijan in 1970 . The Armenians of Karabakh demanded unification with Soviet Armenia . Peaceful protests in Yerevan supporting the Karabakh Armenians were met with anti-Armenian pogroms in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait . Compounding Armenia 's problems was a devastating earthquake in 1988 with a moment magnitude of 7.2 .
Unlike the above antennas , traveling wave antennas are nonresonant so they have inherently broad bandwidth . They are typically wire antennas multiple wavelengths long , through which the voltage and current waves travel in one direction , instead of bouncing back and forth to form standing waves as in resonant antennas . They have linear polarization ( except for the helical antenna ) . Unidirectional traveling wave antennas are terminated by a resistor at one end equal to the antenna 's characteristic resistance , to absorb the waves from one direction . This makes them inefficient as transmitting antennas .
Ashkenazi Jews have a noted history of achievement in Western societies in the fields of exact and social sciences , literature , finance , politics , media , and others . In those societies where they have been free to enter any profession , they have a record of high occupational achievement , entering professions and fields of commerce where higher education is required . Ashkenazi Jews have won a large number of the Nobel awards . While they make up about 2 % of the U.S. population , 27 % of United States Nobel prize winners in the 20th century , a quarter of Fields Medal winners , 25 % of ACM Turing Award winners , half the world 's chess champions , including 8 % of the top 100 world chess players , and a quarter of Westinghouse Science Talent Search winners have Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry .
A format called quiet storm is often included in urban adult contemporary , and is often played during the evening , blending the urban AC and soft AC styles of music . The music that is played is strictly ballads and slow jams , mostly but not limited to Black and Latino artists . Popular artists in the quiet storm format are Teena Marie , Freddie Jackson , Johnny Gill , Lalah Hathaway , Vanessa L. Williams , Toni Braxton , and En Vogue among others .
Public notice is given through legal notices in newspapers , and communicated to state and county agencies within the species ' area . Foreign nations may also receive notice of a listing . A public hearing is mandatory if any person has requested one within 45 days of the published notice . " The purpose of the notice and comment requirement is to provide for meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process . " summarized the Ninth Circuit court in the case of Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbitt .
The modern English word green comes from the Middle English and Anglo-Saxon word grene , from the same Germanic root as the words " grass " and " grow " . It is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime , growth and nature . By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll , the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage . Several minerals have a green color , including the emerald , which is colored green by its chromium content .
At all airports the use of a traffic pattern ( often called a traffic circuit outside the U.S. ) is possible . They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft . There is no technical need within modern aviation for performing this pattern , provided there is no queue . And due to the so-called SLOT-times , the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided . If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 ( which has a heading of approx . 170 degrees ) from the north ( coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees ) , the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the glidepath , without orbit the runway for visual reasons , whenever this is possible . For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without ILS equipment , things are very differently though .
Richmond has a significant arts community , some of which is contained in formal public-supported venues , and some of which is more DIY , such as local privately owned galleries , and private music venues , nonprofit arts organizations , or organic and venueless arts movements ( e.g. , house shows , busking , itinerant folk shows ) . This has led to tensions , as the city Richmond City levied an " admissions tax " to fund large arts projects like CentreStage , leading to criticism that it is funding civic initiatives on the backs of the organic local culture . Traditional Virginian folk music , including blues , country , and bluegrass are also notably present , and play a large part in the annual Richmond Folk Festival . The following is a list of the more formal arts establishments ( Companies , theaters , galleries , and other large venues ) in Richmond :
Internet cafés that provide net access , office applications and multiplayer gaming are also a common sight in the country , while mobile internet on 3G and 4G- LTE cellphone networks and Wi-Fi connections can be found almost everywhere . 3G/4G mobile internet usage has been on a sharp increase in recent years , with a 340 % increase between August 2011 and August 2012 . The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks Greece among the top 30 countries with a highly developed information and communications infrastructure .
Nicholas Lezard described post-punk as " a fusion of art and music " . The era saw the robust appropriation of ideas from literature , art , cinema , philosophy , politics and critical theory into musical and pop cultural contexts . Artists sought to refuse the common distinction between high and low culture and returned to the art school tradition found in the work of artists such as Captain Beefheart and David Bowie . Among major influences on a variety of post-punk artists were writers such as William S. Burroughs and J.G . Ballard , avant-garde political scenes such as Situationism and Dada , and intellectual movements such as postmodernism . Many artists viewed their work in explicitly political terms . Additionally , in some locations , the creation of post-punk music was closely linked to the development of efficacious subcultures , which played important roles in the production of art , multimedia performances , fanzines and independent labels related to the music . Many post-punk artists maintained an anti-corporatist approach to recording and instead seized on alternate means of producing and releasing music . Journalists also became an important element of the culture , and popular music magazines and critics became immersed in the movement .
The Thomson Corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the 1979 Energy Crisis and union demands . Management were left with no choice but to find a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles , and also one who had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods .
The governments in Berlin , Bremen and Hamburg are designated by the term Senate . In the three free states of Bavaria , Saxony , and Thuringia the government is referred to as the State Government ( Staatsregierung ) , and in the other ten states the term Land Government ( Landesregierung ) is used . Before January 1 , 2000 , Bavaria had a bicameral parliament , with a popularly elected Landtag , and a Senate made up of representatives of the state 's major social and economic groups . The Senate was abolished following a referendum in 1998 . The states of Berlin , Bremen , and Hamburg are governed slightly differently from the other states . In each of those cities , the executive branch consists of a Senate of approximately eight , selected by the state 's parliament ; the senators carry out duties equivalent to those of the ministers in the larger states . The equivalent of the Minister-President is the Senatspräsident ( President of the Senate ) in Bremen , the Erster Bürgermeister ( First Mayor ) in Hamburg , and the Regierender Bürgermeister ( Governing Mayor ) in Berlin . The parliament for Berlin is called the Abgeordnetenhaus ( House of Representatives ) , while Bremen and Hamburg both have a Bürgerschaft . The parliaments in the remaining 13 states are referred to as Landtag ( State Parliament ) .
Vietnam : The event was held in Ho Chi Minh City on April 29 . Some 60 torchbearers carried the torch from the downtown Opera House to the Military Zone 7 Competition Hall stadium near Tan Son Nhat International Airport along an undisclosed route . Vietnam is involved in a territorial dispute with China ( and other countries ) for sovereignty of the Spratly and Paracel Islands ; tensions have risen recently [ when ? ] following reports that the Chinese government had established a county-level city named Sansha in the disputed territories , resulting in anti-Chinese demonstrations in December 2007 in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City . However to sustain its relationship with China the Vietnamese government has actively sought to head off protests during the torch relay , with Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng warning government agencies that " hostile forces " may try to disrupt the torch relay .
Following the Army of the Loire 's defeats , Gambetta turned to General Faidherbe 's Army of the North . The army had achieved several small victories at towns such as Ham , La Hallue , and Amiens and was protected by the belt of fortresses in northern France , allowing Faidherbe 's men to launch quick attacks against isolated Prussian units , then retreat behind the fortresses . Despite access to the armaments factories of Lille , the Army of the North suffered from severe supply difficulties , which depressed morale . In January 1871 , Gambetta forced Faidherbe to march his army beyond the fortresses and engage the Prussians in open battle . The army was severely weakened by low morale , supply problems , the terrible winter weather and low troop quality , whilst general Faidherbe was unable to command due to his poor health , the result of decades of campaigning in West Africa . At the Battle of St. Quentin , the Army of the North suffered a crushing defeat and was scattered , releasing thousands of Prussian soldiers to be relocated to the East .
Possibly as early as the second century AD , Virgil 's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination . In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae ( Virgilian Lots ) , passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions . In the 12th century , starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe , a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician . Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years , arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves . Virgil 's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name , Fferyllt or Pheryllt , became a generic term for magic-worker , and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist , fferyllydd .
It was granted its Royal Charter in 1837 under King William IV . Supplemental Charters of 1887 , 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single Charter in 1971 , and there have been minor amendments since then .
In the early 20th century Valencia was an industrialised city . The silk industry had disappeared , but there was a large production of hides and skins , wood , metals and foodstuffs , this last with substantial exports , particularly of wine and citrus . Small businesses predominated , but with the rapid mechanisation of industry larger companies were being formed . The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions , including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue L'Albereda ( Paseo de la Alameda ) , which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry . Among the most architecturally successful buildings of the era were those designed in the Art Nouveau style , such as the North Station ( Gare du Nord ) and the Central and Columbus markets .
However , relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems , and fewer still have organised response mechanisms in place . As result , as Reuters points out : " Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets " . The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated " detection " systems . Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using packet capture appliances that puts criminals behind bars .
Rajasthan is known for its traditional , colorful art . The block prints , tie and dye prints , Bagaru prints , Sanganer prints , and Zari embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan . Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts , carpets , and blue pottery are commonly found here . Shopping reflects the colorful culture , Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery . A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top , also known as a lehenga or a chaniya choli . A piece of cloth is used to cover the head , both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty . Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colors like blue , yellow and orange .
The Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) , headed by the Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy , includes 33 warships and submarines deployed in two fleets : Maritime Forces Pacific ( MARPAC ) at CFB Esquimalt on the west coast , and Maritime Forces Atlantic ( MARLANT ) at Her Majesty 's Canadian Dockyard in Halifax on the east coast , as well as one formation : the Naval Reserve Headquarters ( NAVRESHQ ) at Quebec City , Quebec . The fleet is augmented by various aircraft and supply vessels . The RCN participates in NATO exercises and operations , and ships are deployed all over the world in support of multinational deployments .
In May 1967 , the Eastern Region declared independence as a state called the Republic of Biafra , under the leadership of Lt . Colonel Emeka Ojukwu . The Nigerian Civil War began as the official Nigerian government side ( predominated by soldiers from the North and West ) attacked Biafra ( Southeastern ) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem . The 30 month war , with a long siege of Biafra and its isolation from trade and supplies , ended in January 1970 . Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people , from warfare , disease , and starvation , during the 30-month civil war .
In 1609 , English explorer Henry Hudson re-discovered the region when he sailed his ship the Halve Maen ( " Half Moon " in Dutch ) into New York Harbor while searching for the Northwest Passage to the Orient for his employer , the Dutch East India Company . He proceeded to sail up what he named the North River , also called the Mauritis River , and now known as the Hudson River , to the site of the present-day New York State capital of Albany in the belief that it might represent an oceanic tributary . When the river narrowed and was no longer saline , he realized it was not a maritime passage and sailed back downriver . He made a ten-day exploration of the area and claimed the region for his employer . In 1614 , the area between Cape Cod and Delaware Bay would be claimed by the Netherlands and called Nieuw-Nederland ( New Netherland ) .
The Tuvalu Government carried out assessments of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam to the islands and has provided medical aid , food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris . Government and Non-Government Organisations provided assistance technical , funding and material support to Tuvalu to assist with recovery , including WHO , UNICEF , UNDP , OCHA , World Bank , DFAT , New Zealand Red Cross & IFRC , Fiji National University and governments of New Zealand , Netherlands , UAE , Taiwan and the United States .
Earth 's surface and the clouds absorb visible and invisible radiation from the sun and re-emit much of the energy as infrared back to atmosphere . Certain substances in the atmosphere , chiefly cloud droplets and water vapor , but also carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , sulfur hexafluoride , and chlorofluorocarbons , absorb this infrared , and re-radiate it in all directions including back to Earth . Thus , the greenhouse effect keeps the atmosphere and surface much warmer than if the infrared absorbers were absent from the atmosphere .
Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643 without a designated heir . As the Jurchens had traditionally " elected " their leader through a council of nobles , the Qing state did not have in place a clear succession system until the reign of the Kangxi Emperor . The leading contenders for power at this time were Hong Taiji 's oldest son Hooge and Hong Taiji ' half brother Dorgon . A compromise candidate in the person of Hong Taiji 's five-year-old son , Fulin , was installed as the Shunzhi Emperor , with Dorgon as regent and de facto leader of the Manchu nation .
The materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically , famously by René Descartes . However , by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized . In practice , it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another .
Kurita passed through San Bernardino Strait at 03:00 on 25 October and headed along the coast of Samar . The only thing standing in his path were three groups ( Taffy 1 , 2 and 3 ) of the Seventh Fleet , commanded by Admiral Thomas Kinkaid . Each group had six escort carriers , with a total of more than 500 planes , and seven or eight destroyers or destroyer escorts ( DE ) . Kinkaid still believed that Lee 's force was guarding the north , so the Japanese had the element of surprise when they attacked Taffy 3 at 06:45 . Kurita mistook the Taffy carriers for large fleet carriers and thought he had the whole Third Fleet in his sights . Since escort carriers stood little chance against a battleship , Adm. Clifton Sprague directed the carriers of Taffy 3 to turn and flee eastward , hoping that bad visibility would reduce the accuracy of Japanese gunfire , and used his destroyers to divert the Japanese battleships . The destroyers made harassing torpedo attacks against the Japanese . For ten minutes Yamato was caught up in evasive action . Two U.S. destroyers and a DE were sunk , but they had bought enough time for the Taffy groups to launch planes . Taffy 3 turned and fled south , with shells scoring hits on some of its carriers and sinking one of them . The superior speed of the Japanese force allowed it to draw closer and fire on the other two Taffy groups . However , at 09:20 Kurita suddenly turned and retreated north . Signals had disabused him of the notion that he was attacking the Third Fleet , and the longer Kurita continued to engage , the greater the risk of major air strikes . Destroyer attacks had broken the Japanese formations , shattering tactical control . Three of Kurita 's heavy cruisers had been sunk and another was too damaged to continue the fight . The Japanese retreated through the San Bernardino Strait , under continuous air attack . The Battle of Leyte Gulf was over ; and a large part of the Japanese surface fleet destroyed .
In The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism , Popper developed a critique of historicism and a defence of the " Open Society " . Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end . He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of authoritarianism and totalitarianism . He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction . Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history , and since " no society can predict , scientifically , its own future states of knowledge " , it follows , he argued , that there can be no predictive science of human history . For Popper , metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand .
The Fitzroy Tavern is a pub situated at 16 Charlotte Street in the Fitzrovia district , to which it gives its name . It became famous ( or according to others , infamous ) during a period spanning the 1920s to the mid-1950s as a meeting place for many of London 's artists , intellectuals and bohemians such as Dylan Thomas , Augustus John , and George Orwell . Several establishments in Soho , London , have associations with well-known , post-war literary and artistic figures , including the Pillars of Hercules , The Colony Room and the Coach and Horses . The Canonbury Tavern , Canonbury , was the prototype for Orwell 's ideal English pub , The Moon Under Water .
According to most scholars , at some period after the Second Council the Sangha began to break into separate factions . [ note 37 ] The various accounts differ as to when the actual schisms occurred . According to the Dipavamsa of the Pāli tradition , they started immediately after the Second Council , the Puggalavada tradition places it in 137 AN , the Sarvastivada tradition of Vasumitra says it was in the time of Ashoka and the Mahasanghika tradition places it much later , nearly 100 BCE .
About that time the " executionist movement " ( Polish : " egzekucja praw " -- " execution of the laws " ) began to take form . Its members would seek to curb the power of the magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of king and country . In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrków they would force the magnates to return many leased crown lands to the king , and the king to create a standing army ( wojsko kwarciane ) . One of the most famous members of this movement was Jan Zamoyski . After his death in 1605 , the movement lost its political force .
The Nabatean Kingdom was an Arab state located between the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula . Its capital was the city of Petra , an important trading city on the incense route . The Nabateans resisted the attacks of Antigonous and were allies of the Hasmoneans in their struggle against the Seleucids , but later fought against Herod the great . The hellenization of the Nabateans accured relatively late in comparison to the surrounding regions . Nabatean material culture does not show any Greek influence until the reign of Aretas III Philhellene in the 1st century BCE . Aretas captured Damascus and built the Petra pool complex and gardens in the Hellenistic style . Though the Nabateans originally worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form such as stone blocks or pillars , during the Hellenistic period they began to identify their gods with Greek gods and depict them in figurative forms influenced by Greek sculpture . Nabatean art shows Greek influences and paintings have been found depicting Dionysian scenes . They also slowly adopted Greek as a language of commerce along with Aramaic and Arabic .
Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk , tea , and ceramics could only be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China . In the late 1700s , the governments of Britain and France were deeply concerned about the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver . To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium , the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal . Since China 's economy was essentially self-sufficient , the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans , so the usual way of payment was through silver . The Daoguang Emperor , concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects , ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade . Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839 , leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year .
The Berbers along the Barbary Coast ( modern day Libya ) sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom . The U.S. paid protection money until 1801 , when President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay and sent in the Navy to challenge the Barbary States , the First Barbary War followed . After the U.S.S . Philadelphia was captured in 1803 , Lieutenant Stephen Decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship , preventing Tripoli from using or selling it . In 1805 , after William Eaton captured the city of Derna , Tripoli agreed to a peace treaty . The other Barbary states continued to raid U.S. shipping , until the Second Barbary War in 1815 ended the practice .
Organized crime has long been associated with New York City , beginning with the Forty Thieves and the Roach Guards in the Five Points in the 1820s . The 20th century saw a rise in the Mafia , dominated by the Five Families , as well as in gangs , including the Black Spades . The Mafia presence has declined in the city in the 21st century .
According to UNFPA these elements promote the right of " reproductive health " , that is physical , mental , and social health in matters related to reproduction and the reproductive system .
LaserDisc was first available on the market , in Atlanta , Georgia , on December 15 , 1978 , two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR , and four years before the introduction of the CD ( which is based on laser disc technology ) . Initially licensed , sold , and marketed as MCA DiscoVision ( also known as simply " DiscoVision " ) in North America in 1978 , the technology was previously referred to internally as Optical Videodisc System , Reflective Optical Videodisc , Laser Optical Videodisc , and Disco-Vision ( with a dash ) , with the first players referring to the format as " Video Long Play " .
The Pocitos district , near the beach of the same name , has many homes built by Bello and Reboratti between 1920 and 1940 , with a mixture of styles . Other landmarks in Pocitos are the " Edificio Panamericano " designed by Raul Sichero , and the " Positano " and " El Pilar " designed by Adolfo Sommer Smith and Luis García Pardo in the 1950s and 1960s . However , the construction boom of the 1970s and 1980s transformed the face of this neighbourhood , with a cluster of modern apartment buildings for upper and upper middle class residents .

Some USB devices require more power than is permitted by the specifications for a single port . This is common for external hard and optical disc drives , and generally for devices with motors or lamps . Such devices can use an external power supply , which is allowed by the standard , or use a dual-input USB cable , one input of which is used for power and data transfer , the other solely for power , which makes the device a non-standard USB device . Some USB ports and external hubs can , in practice , supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this .
In the 16th century , Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as Joachimstalers ( from German thal , or nowadays usually Tal , " valley " , cognate with " dale " in English ) , named for Joachimstal , the valley where the silver was mined ( St. Joachim 's Valley , now Jáchymov ; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia , now part of the Czech Republic ) . Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler , a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler , Norwegian as dalar and daler , Dutch as daler or daalder , Ethiopian as ታላሪ ( talari ) , Hungarian as tallér , Italian as tallero , and English as dollar . Alternatively , thaler is said to come from the German coin Guldengroschen ( " great guilder " , being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder ) , minted from the silver from Joachimsthal .
In recent years , the city has experienced steady population growth , and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents . In 2006 , after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years , regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040 . However , former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60 % , or 350,000 people , by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle 's single-family housing zoning laws . The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown , partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city centre . As a sign of increasing inner-city growth , the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009 , up 77 % since 1990 .
Another body established under the Good Friday Agreement , the British–Irish Council , is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles . The British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly ( Irish : Tionól Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na hÉireann ) predates the British–Irish Council and was established in 1990 . Originally it comprised 25 members of the Oireachtas , the Irish parliament , and 25 members of the parliament of the United Kingdom , with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures . Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , the Northern Ireland Assembly , the States of Jersey , the States of Guernsey and the High Court of Tynwald ( Isle of Man ) .
One significant part of treaty making is that signing a treaty implies recognition that the other side is a sovereign state and that the agreement being considered is enforceable under international law . Hence , nations can be very careful about terming an agreement to be a treaty . For example , within the United States , agreements between states are compacts and agreements between states and the federal government or between agencies of the government are memoranda of understanding .
In September 2008 , the crisis hit its most critical stage . There was the equivalent of a bank run on the money market funds , which frequently invest in commercial paper issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls . Withdrawal from money markets were $ 144.5 billion during one week , versus $ 7.1 billion the week prior . This interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover ( replace ) their short-term debt . The U.S. government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank deposit insurance via a temporary guarantee and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper . The TED spread , an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy , spiked up in July 2007 , remained volatile for a year , then spiked even higher in September 2008 , reaching a record 4.65 % on October 10 , 2008 .
Sho-1 called for V. Adm. Jisaburo Ozawa 's force to use an apparently vulnerable carrier force to lure the U.S. 3rd Fleet away from Leyte and remove air cover from the Allied landing forces , which would then be attacked from the west by three Japanese forces : V. Adm. Takeo Kurita 's force would enter Leyte Gulf and attack the landing forces ; R. Adm. Shoji Nishimura 's force and V. Adm. Kiyohide Shima 's force would act as mobile strike forces . The plan was likely to result in the destruction of one or more of the Japanese forces , but Toyoda justified it by saying that there would be no sense in saving the fleet and losing the Philippines .
The rule of law has been considered as one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country . Research , like the Worldwide Governance Indicators , defines the rule of law as : " the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society , and in particular the quality of contract enforcement , the police and the courts , as well as the likelihood of crime or violence . " Based on this definition the Worldwide Governance Indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries , as seen in the map below . A government based on the rule of law can be called a " nomocracy " , from the Greek nomos ( law ) and kratos ( power or rule ) .
Desktop computers and laptops are commonly infected with malware either to gather passwords or financial account information , or to construct a botnet to attack another target . Smart phones , tablet computers , smart watches , and other mobile devices such as Quantified Self devices like activity trackers have also become targets and many of these have sensors such as cameras , microphones , GPS receivers , compasses , and accelerometers which could be exploited , and may collect personal information , including sensitive health information . Wifi , Bluetooth , and cell phone network on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors , and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach .
New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League , Major League Baseball , the National Basketball Association , the National Hockey League , and Major League Soccer . The New York metropolitan area hosts the most sports teams in these five professional leagues . Participation in professional sports in the city predates all professional leagues , and the city has been continuously hosting professional sports since the birth of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1882 . The city has played host to over forty major professional teams in the five sports and their respective competing leagues , both current and historic . Four of the ten most expensive stadiums ever built worldwide ( MetLife Stadium , the new Yankee Stadium , Madison Square Garden , and Citi Field ) are located in the New York metropolitan area . Madison Square Garden , its predecessor , as well as the original Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field , are some of the most famous sporting venues in the world , the latter two having been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps .
The Odrysian Kingdom was a union of Thracian tribes under the kings of the powerful Odrysian tribe centered around the region of Thrace . Various parts of Thrace were under Macedonian rule under Philip II of Macedon , Alexander the Great , Lysimachus , Ptolemy II , and Philip V but were also often ruled by their own kings . The Thracians and Agrianes were widely used by Alexander as peltasts and light cavalry , forming about one fifth of his army . The Diadochi also used Thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists . The Odrysians used Greek as the language of administration and of the nobility . The nobility also adopted Greek fashions in dress , ornament and military equipment , spreading it to the other tribes . Thracian kings were among the first to be Hellenized .
However , some scholars contest the idea of a Proto-Euphratean language or one substrate language . It has been suggested by them and others , that the Sumerian language was originally that of the hunter and fisher peoples , who lived in the marshland and the Eastern Arabia littoral region , and were part of the Arabian bifacial culture . Reliable historical records begin much later ; there are none in Sumer of any kind that have been dated before Enmebaragesi ( c. 26th century BC ) . Professor Juris Zarins believes the Sumerians were settled along the coast of Eastern Arabia , today 's Persian Gulf region , before it flooded at the end of the Ice Age .
In the early 1880s , Kanehiro Takaki observed that Japanese sailors ( whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice ) developed beriberi ( or endemic neuritis , a disease causing heart problems and paralysis ) , but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not . Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease , ( not because of the increased protein as Takaki supposed but because it introduced a few parts per million of thiamine to the diet , later understood as a cure ) .
In 2003 , Harding Earley Follmer & Frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the Archive 's Wayback Machine . The attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid , based on the content of their web site from several years prior . The plaintiff , Healthcare Advocates , then amended their complaint to include the Internet Archive , accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act . Healthcare Advocates claimed that , since they had installed a robots.txt file on their web site , even if after the initial lawsuit was filed , the Archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff web site from the Wayback Machine . The lawsuit was settled out of court .

This service allows users to access the Music Store from either an iPhone or an iPod Touch and download songs directly to the device that can be synced to the user 's iTunes Library over a WiFi connection , or , in the case of an iPhone , the telephone network .
Three-phase AC railway electrification was used in Italy , Switzerland and the United States in the early twentieth century . Italy was the major user , for lines in the mountainous regions of northern Italy from 1901 until 1976 . The first lines were the Burgdorf-Thun line in Switzerland ( 1899 ) , and the lines of the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina from Colico to Chiavenna and Tirano in Italy , which were electrified in 1901 and 1902 . Other lines where the three-phase system were used were the Simplon Tunnel in Switzerland from 1906 to 1930 , and the Cascade Tunnel of the Great Northern Railway in the United States from 1909 to 1927 .
Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931 , the all Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms , the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills . They , therefore , are unlikely to advise the sovereign or his or her representative to withhold assent . The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta 's lieutenant governor , John C. Bowen , in 1937 , in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart 's Social Credit party . Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province , thereby interfering with the federal government 's powers . The third , the Accurate News and Information Bill , purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected . The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council .
The Slavs under name of the Antes and the Sclaveni make their first appearance in Byzantine records in the early 6th century . Byzantine historiographers under Justinian I ( 527–565 ) , such as Procopius of Caesarea , Jordanes and Theophylact Simocatta describe tribes of these names emerging from the area of the Carpathian Mountains , the lower Danube and the Black Sea , invading the Danubian provinces of the Eastern Empire .
People are usually well informed about their health status , the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services . Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations . Thus , survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services . Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal ( Kasmel et al. , 2004 ) . This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity .
Though traditionally a moderate newspaper and sometimes a supporter of the Conservative Party , it supported the Labour Party in the 2001 and 2005 general elections . In 2004 , according to MORI , the voting intentions of its readership were 40 % for the Conservative Party , 29 % for the Liberal Democrats , and 26 % for Labour . The Times had an average daily circulation of 394,448 in March 2014 ; in the same period , The Sunday Times had an average daily circulation of 839,077 . An American edition of The Times has been published since 6 June 2006 . It has been heavily used by scholars and researchers because of its widespread availability in libraries and its detailed index . A complete historical file of the digitized paper is online from Gage Cengage publisher .
The son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder , Gaddafi became involved in politics while at school in Sabha , subsequently enrolling in the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi . Founding a revolutionary cell within the military , in 1969 they seized power from the absolute monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup . Becoming Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council ( RCC ) , Gaddafi abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic . Ruling by decree , he implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya , and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments . Intent on pushing Libya towards " Islamic socialism " , he introduced sharia as the basis for the legal system and nationalized the oil industry , using the increased revenues to bolster the military , implement social programs and fund revolutionary militants across the world . In 1973 he initiated a " Popular Revolution " with the formation of General People 's Committees ( GPCs ) , purported to be a system of direct democracy , but retained personal control over major decisions . He outlined his Third International Theory that year , publishing these ideas in The Green Book .
He was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse . He was spotted and filmed in 2015 Summer in his car , silver painted with bright aluminium forged wheels . Schwarzenegger 's Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather .
A text is self-referential when it speaks about itself and makes reference to itself . According to Stefan Wild , the Quran demonstrates this metatextuality by explaining , classifying , interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted . Self-referentiality is evident in those passages where the Quran refers to itself as revelation ( tanzil ) , remembrance ( dhikr ) , news ( naba ' ) , criterion ( furqan ) in a self-designating manner ( explicitly asserting its Divinity , " And this is a blessed Remembrance that We have sent down ; so are you now denying it ? " ) , or in the frequent appearance of the " Say " tags , when Muhammad is commanded to speak ( e.g. , " Say : 'God 's guidance is the true guidance ' " , " Say : 'Would you then dispute with us concerning God ? ' " ) . According to Wild the Quran is highly self-referential . The feature is more evident in early Meccan suras .
Like in English , Dutch has generalised the dative over the accusative case for all pronouns , e.g . Du me , je , Eng me , you , vs. Germ mich/mir dich/dir . There is one exception : the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural , hen is to be used for the direct object , and hun for the indirect object . This distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians , and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by Dutch speakers . Consequently , the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage , with hun being more common . The shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use .
In 1925 the British adopted a new instrument developed by Vickers . It was a mechanical analogue computer Predictor AA No 1 . Given the target height its operators tracked the target and the predictor produced bearing , quadrant elevation and fuse setting . These were passed electrically to the guns where they were displayed on repeater dials to the layers who 'matched pointers ' ( target data and the gun 's actual data ) to lay the guns . This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the 1880s , and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers . Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry device , designated M3A3 in the US was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No 2 . Height finders were also increasing in size , in Britain , the World War I Barr & Stroud UB 2 ( 7 feet optical base ) was replaced by the UB 7 ( 9 feet optical base ) and the UB 10 ( 18 feet optical base , only used on static AA sites ) . Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced 5 metre instruments . However , in most countries the main effort in HAA guns until the mid-1930s was improving existing ones , although various new designs were on drawing boards .
The trends of Hellenization were therefore accompanied by Greeks adopting native ways over time , but this was widely varied by place and by social class . The farther away from the Mediterranean and the lower in social status , the more likely that a colonist was to adopt local ways , while the Greco-Macedonian elites and Royal families , usually remained thoroughly Greek and viewed most non-Greeks with disdain . It is only until Cleopatra VII , that a Ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the Egyptian language of their subjects .
In 1869 the Suez Canal opened under Napoleon III , linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean . Initially the Canal was opposed by the British ; but once opened , its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the " jugular vein of the Empire " . In 1875 , the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma'il Pasha 's 44 percent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million ( £340 million in 2013 ) . Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway , it did give Britain leverage . Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882 . The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position , but a compromise was reached with the 1888 Convention of Constantinople , which made the Canal officially neutral territory .
Over 90 weeklies , fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit . Sudharma , a daily newspaper in Sanskrit , has been published out of Mysore , India , since 1970 , while Sanskrit Vartman Patram and Vishwasya Vrittantam started in Gujarat during the last five years . Since 1974 , there has been a short daily news broadcast on state-run All India Radio . These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR 's website . Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel at 6:55 AM IST .
After the setback at Aspern-Essling , Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube . From 30 June to the early days of July , the French recrossed the Danube in strength , with more than 180,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians . Charles received the French with 150,000 of his own men . In the ensuing Battle of Wagram , which also lasted two days , Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then . Neither side made much progress on 5 July , but the 6th produced a definitive outcome . Both sides launched major assaults on their flanks . Austrian attacks against the French left wing looked dangerous initially , but they were all beaten back . Meanwhile , a steady French attack against the Austrian left wing eventually compromised the entire position for Charles . Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat . Austrian losses were very heavy , reaching well over 40,000 casualties . The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately , but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July .
Masonic lodges created a private model for public affairs . They " reconstituted the polity and established a constitutional form of self-government , complete with constitutions and laws , elections and representatives . " In other words , the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole . This was especially true on the Continent : when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s , their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities . For example , the Parisian lodge that met in the mid 1720s was composed of English Jacobite exiles . Furthermore , freemasons all across Europe explicitly linked themselves to the Enlightenment as a whole . In French lodges , for example , the line " As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened " was a part of their initiation rites . British lodges assigned themselves the duty to " initiate the unenlightened " . This did not necessarily link lodges to the irreligious , but neither did this exclude them from the occasional heresy . In fact , many lodges praised the Grand Architect , the masonic terminology for the deistic divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe .
Detroit has struggled with high crime for decades . Detroit held the title of murder capital between 1985-1987 with a murder rate around 58 per 100,000 . Crime has since decreased and , in 2014 , the murder rate was 43.4 per 100,000 , lower than in St. Louis , Missouri . Although the murder rate increased by 6 % during the first half of 2015 , it was surpassed by St Louis and Baltimore which saw much greater spikes in violence . At year-end 2015 , Detroit had 295 criminal homicides , down slightly from 299 in 2014 .
After the Rus ' attack on Constantinople in 860 , the Byzantine Patriarch Photius sent missionaries north to convert the Rus ' and the Slavs . Prince Rastislav of Moravia had requested the Emperor to provide teachers to interpret the holy scriptures , so in 863 the brothers Cyril and Methodius were sent as missionaries , due to their knowledge of the Slavonic language . The Slavs had no written language , so the brothers devised the Glagolitic alphabet , later developed into Cyrillic , and standardized the language of the Slavs , later known as Old Church Slavonic . They translated portions of the Bible and drafted the first Slavic civil code and other documents , and the language and texts spread throughout Slavic territories , including Kievan Rus ’ . The mission of Cyril and Methodius served both evangelical and diplomatic purposes , spreading Byzantine cultural influence in support of imperial foreign policy . In 867 the Patriarch announced that the Rus ' had accepted a bishop , and in 874 he speaks of an " Archbishop of the Rus ' . "
The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910 ; however , decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread . Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the " pesticide era . " Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972 , pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes ( 2.5 million short tons ) of industrial pesticides are now [ when ? ] used each year . Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries , but use in developing countries is increasing . A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation 's Center for Integrated Pest Management .
The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are glutamate , which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons , and gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , which is almost always inhibitory . Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain . Because of their ubiquity , drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects . Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate ; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA .
In the US , starting in 2013 , under the Physician Financial Transparency Reports ( part of the Sunshine Act ) , the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals . Data are made public in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website . The expectation is that relationship between doctors and Pharmaceutical industry will become fully transparent .
Positioned asymmetrically around the South Pole and largely south of the Antarctic Circle , Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean ; alternatively , it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian Oceans , or by the southern waters of the World Ocean . It covers more than 14,000,000 km2 ( 5,400,000 sq mi ) , making it the fifth-largest continent , about 1.3 times as large as Europe . The coastline measures 17,968 km ( 11,165 mi ) and is mostly characterized by ice formations , as the following table shows :
The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes , who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin . Congo-Brazzaville was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa . Upon independence in 1960 , the former colony of French Congo became the Republic of the Congo . The People 's Republic of the Congo was a Marxist–Leninist one-party state from 1970 to 1991 . Multi-party elections have been held since 1992 , although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 Republic of the Congo Civil War and President Denis Sassou Nguesso has ruled for 26 of the past 36 years .
Perhaps the biggest sustainability problem in Tucson , with its high desert climate , is potable water supply . The state manages all water in Arizona through its Arizona Department of Water Resources ( ADWR ) . The primary consumer of water is Agriculture ( including golf courses ) , which consumes about 69 % of all water . Municipal ( which includes residential use ) accounts for about 25 % of use . Energy consumption and availability is another sustainability issue . However , with over 300 days of full sun a year , Tucson has demonstrated its potential to be an ideal solar energy producer .
Animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment . Green animals include , especially , amphibians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . Most fish , reptiles , amphibians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment . Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . For example , broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light . Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments , sometimes caused by diet . This can causes their feces to look green as well . Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins ( lychochromes ) and hemanovadin . Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one 's skin include biliverdin , the green pigment in bile , and ceruloplasmin , a protein that carries copper ions in chelation .
Since the 19th century , the built-up area of Paris has grown far beyond its administrative borders ; together with its suburbs , the whole agglomeration has a population of 10,550,350 ( Jan. 2012 census ) . Paris ' metropolitan area spans most of the Paris region and has a population of 12,341,418 ( Jan. 2012 census ) , or one-fifth of the population of France . The administrative region covers 12,012 km² ( 4,638 mi² ) , with approximately 12 million inhabitants as of 2014 , and has its own regional council and president .
In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula 's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed . Between 28 February and 8 March 2008 , about 570 km2 ( 220 sq mi ) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed , putting the remaining 15,000 km2 ( 5,800 sq mi ) of the ice shelf at risk . The ice was being held back by a " thread " of ice about 6 km ( 4 mi ) wide , prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009 . According to NASA , the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005 , when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze ; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C ( 41 °F ) .
Bal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s ; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls in the working-class neighbourhoods of the city . Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette ( a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a " musette " ) and often the vielle à roue ( hurdy-gurdy ) in the cafés and bars of the city . Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement , and the romantic sounds of the accordion has since become one of the musical icons of the city . Paris became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés .
Registered dietitian nutritionists ( RDs or RDNs ) are health professionals qualified to provide safe , evidence-based dietary advice which includes a review of what is eaten , a thorough review of nutritional health , and a personalized nutritional treatment plan . They also provide preventive and therapeutic programs at work places , schools and similar institutions . Certified Clinical Nutritionists or CCNs , are trained health professionals who also offer dietary advice on the role of nutrition in chronic disease , including possible prevention or remediation by addressing nutritional deficiencies before resorting to drugs . Government regulation especially in terms of licensing , is currently less universal for the CCN than that of RD or RDN . Another advanced Nutrition Professional is a Certified Nutrition Specialist or CNS . These Board Certified Nutritionists typically specialize in obesity and chronic disease . In order to become board certified , potential CNS candidate must pass an examination , much like Registered Dieticians . This exam covers specific domains within the health sphere including ; Clinical Intervention and Human Health .
In 1947 , the King and his family toured Southern Africa . The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa , Jan Smuts , was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit . George was appalled , however , when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites , and referred to his South African bodyguards as " the Gestapo " . Despite the tour , Smuts lost the election the following year , and the new government instituted a strict policy of racial segregation .
Minute Maid Park ( home of the Astros ) and Toyota Center ( home of the Rockets ) , are located in downtown Houston . Houston has the NFL 's first retractable-roof stadium with natural grass , NRG Stadium ( home of the Texans ) . Minute Maid Park is also a retractable-roof stadium . Toyota Center also has the largest screen for an indoor arena in the United States built to coincide with the arena 's hosting of the 2013 NBA All-Star Game . BBVA Compass Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium for the Dynamo , the Texas Southern University football team , and Dash , located in East Downtown . In addition , NRG Astrodome was the first indoor stadium in the world , built in 1965 . Other sports facilities include Hofheinz Pavilion ( Houston Cougars basketball ) , Rice Stadium ( Rice Owls football ) , and Reliant Arena . TDECU Stadium is where the University of Houston Houston Cougars football team plays . Houston has hosted several major sports events : the 1968 , 1986 and 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Games ; the 1989 , 2006 and 2013 NBA All-Star Games ; Super Bowl VIII and Super Bowl XXXVIII , as well as hosting the 2005 World Series and 1981 , 1986 , 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals , winning the latter two . Super Bowl LI is currently slated to be hosted in NRG Stadium in 2017 .
Throughout the 19th century , Philadelphia had a variety of industries and businesses , the largest being textiles . Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works , William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company , and the Pennsylvania Railroad . Industry , along with the U.S. Centennial , was celebrated in 1876 with the Centennial Exposition , the first official World 's Fair in the United States . Immigrants , mostly Irish and German , settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts . The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854 , which extended the city limits of Philadelphia from the 2 square miles of present-day Center City to the roughly 130 square miles of Philadelphia County .
The Ministry of Defence and the Defence Forces have been working on a cyberwarfare and defence formation for some years now . In 2007 , a military doctrine of an e-military of Estonia was officially introduced as the country was under massive cyberattacks in 2007 . The proposed aim of the e-military is to secure the vital infrastructure and e-infrastructure of Estonia . The main cyber warfare facility is the Computer Emergency Response Team of Estonia ( CERT ) , founded in 2006 . The organisation operates on security issues in local networks .
Hisham suffered still worse defeats in the east , where his armies attempted to subdue both Tokharistan , with its center at Balkh , and Transoxiana , with its center at Samarkand . Both areas had already been partially conquered , but remained difficult to govern . Once again , a particular difficulty concerned the question of the conversion of non-Arabs , especially the Sogdians of Transoxiana . Following the Umayyad defeat in the " Day of Thirst " in 724 , Ashras ibn 'Abd Allah al-Sulami , governor of Khurasan , promised tax relief to those Sogdians who converted to Islam , but went back on his offer when it proved too popular and threatened to reduce tax revenues . Discontent among the Khurasani Arabs rose sharply after the losses suffered in the Battle of the Defile in 731 , and in 734 , al-Harith ibn Surayj led a revolt that received broad backing from Arabs and natives alike , capturing Balkh but failing to take Merv . After this defeat , al-Harith 's movement seems to have been dissolved , but the problem of the rights of non-Arab Muslims would continue to plague the Umayyads .
On 2 March 1979 , the GPC announced the separation of government and revolution , the latter being represented by new Revolutionary Committees , who operated in tandem with the People 's Committees in schools , universities , unions , the police force and the military . Dominated by revolutionary zealots , the Revolutionary Committees were led by Mohammad Maghgoub and a Central Coordinating Office , and met with Gaddafi annually . Publishing a weekly magazine The Green March ( al-Zahf al-Akhdar ) , in October 1980 they took control of the press . Responsible for perpetuating revolutionary fervour , they performed ideological surveillance , later adopting a significant security role , making arrests and putting people on trial according to the " law of the revolution " ( qanun al-thawra ) . With no legal code or safeguards , the administration of revolutionary justice was largely arbitrary and resulted in widespread abuses and the suppression of civil liberties : the " Green Terror . "
In Australia , a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001 . In 1976 , a bill originating in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to . However , it was later discovered that it had not been passed by each house . The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the house . The Governor-General revoked the first assent , before assenting to the bill which had actually passed . The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001 .
However , Lok-Ham Chan , a professor of history at the University of Washington , writes that Changchub Gyaltsen 's aims were to recreate the old Tibetan Kingdom that existed during the Chinese Tang dynasty , to build " nationalist sentiment " amongst Tibetans , and to " remove all traces of Mongol suzerainty . " Georges Dreyfus , a professor of religion at Williams College , writes that it was Changchub Gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of Songtsän Gampo ( c. 605–649 ) —the first leader of the Tibetan Empire to establish Tibet as a strong power—by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units . For example , instead of the 13 governorships established by the Mongol Sakya viceroy , Changchub Gyaltsen divided Central Tibet into districts ( dzong ) with district heads ( dzong dpon ) who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old Imperial Tibet . Van Praag asserts that Changchub Gyaltsen 's ambitions were to " restore to Tibet the glories of its Imperial Age " by reinstating secular administration , promoting " national culture and traditions , " and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century .
In 2004 the old Drake Circus shopping centre and Charles Cross car park were demolished and replaced by the latest Drake Circus Shopping Centre , which opened in October 2006 . It received negative feedback before opening when David Mackay said it was already " ten years out of date " . In contrast , the Theatre Royal 's production and education centre , TR2 , which was built on wasteland at Cattedown , was a runner-up for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2003 .
Gaddafi 's earliest education was of a religious nature , imparted by a local Islamic teacher . Subsequently moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school , he progressed through six grades in four years . Education in Libya was not free , but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain . During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque , and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents . Bullied for being a Bedouin , he was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children . From Sirte , he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan , south-central Libya , where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school , something neither parent had done . Gaddafi was popular at school ; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration , most notably his best friend Abdul Salam Jalloud .
Richmond is located at the fall line of the James River , 44 miles ( 71 km ) west of Williamsburg , 66 miles ( 106 km ) east of Charlottesville , and 98 miles ( 158 km ) south of Washington , D.C . Surrounded by Henrico and Chesterfield counties , the city is located at the intersections of Interstate 95 and Interstate 64 , and encircled by Interstate 295 and Virginia State Route 288 . Major suburbs include Midlothian to the southwest , Glen Allen to the north and west , Short Pump to the west and Mechanicsville to the northeast .
The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord . At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons , which control stereotyped movements such as walking , breathing , or swallowing . At a higher level are areas in the midbrain , such as the red nucleus , which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs . At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex , a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe . The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas , but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord , through the pyramidal tract . This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements . Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas . Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex , basal ganglia , and cerebellum .
Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting , chosen to evoke emotions . " A certain blue penetrates your soul " , he wrote . " A certain red affects your blood pressure . " He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors , such as red and green , strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other . He wrote , " My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory ; it is based on observation , upon feelings , upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings . "
After receiving his J.D . from Boston College Law School , Kerry worked in Massachusetts as an Assistant District Attorney . He served as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis from 1983 to 1985 and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and was sworn in the following January . On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he led a series of hearings from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the Iran–Contra affair . Kerry was re-elected to additional terms in 1990 , 1996 , 2002 and 2008 . In 2002 , Kerry voted to authorize the President " to use force , if necessary , to disarm Saddam Hussein " , but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war .
The Scooter is another storm , a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot . This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989 , when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot ( and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2 ) . The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm , the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter . It was initially completely dark , but as Voyager 2 approached the planet , a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images .
Extensive and diverse public spending is , in itself , inherently at risk of cronyism , kickbacks , and embezzlement . Complicated regulations and arbitrary , unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem . This is one argument for privatization and deregulation . Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological . The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors , like the Nordic countries . These countries score high on the Ease of Doing Business Index , due to good and often simple regulations , and have rule of law firmly established . Therefore , due to their lack of corruption in the first place , they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption . Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption .
Worldwide , more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry , with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs . Traditionally , such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks , foraging during the day and housed at night . This is still the case in developing countries , where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry . However , rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger , more intensive specialist units . These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed , and result in cheap , safe food being made available for urban communities . Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed , which has been rising . High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production .
Yale and New Haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and Greater New Haven region , and are succeeding to some extent . [ citation needed ] The city , state and Yale together run Science Park , a large site three blocks northwest of Yale 's Science Hill campus . This multi-block site , approximately bordered by Mansfield Street , Division Street , and Shelton Avenue , is the former home of Winchester 's and Olin Corporation 's 45 large-scale factory buildings . Currently , sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures , but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings ( leased primarily by a private developer ) with numerous Yale employees , financial service and biotech companies .
Yale University is an American private Ivy League research university in New Haven , Connecticut . Founded in 1701 in Saybrook Colony as the Collegiate School , the University is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States . The school was renamed Yale College in 1718 in recognition of a gift from Elihu Yale , who was governor of the British East India Company . Established to train Congregationalist ministers in theology and sacred languages , by 1777 the school 's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences . In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction , awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887 .
In 2006 , Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service . Issues included call transfers of more than 45 % of calls and long wait times . Dell 's blog detailed the response : " We 're spending more than a $ 100 million — and a lot of blood , sweat and tears of talented people — to fix this . " Later in the year , the company increased its spending on customer service to $ 150 million . Despite significant investment in this space , Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company 's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process .

In 1981 , the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued a hard line approach to Libya , erroneously considering it a puppet regime of the Soviet Union . In turn , Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets , visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985 , and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact . The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi , seeing him as an unpredictable extremist . Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them . Closing down Libya 's embassy in Washington , D.C. , Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there . In March 1982 , the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil , and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country , although several hundred workers remained . Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K. , after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher , a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy , in April 1984 . In Spring 1986 , the U.S. Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte ; the Libyan military retaliated , but failed as the U.S. sank several Libyan ships .
Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation . Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet . Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier . Its largest moon , Triton , was discovered shortly thereafter , though none of the planet 's remaining known 14 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century . The planet 's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size , making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes . Neptune was visited by Voyager 2 , when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989 . The advent of Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar .
After the Incheon landing , the 1st Cavalry Division began its northward advance from the Pusan Perimeter . " Task Force Lynch " ( after Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch ) , 3rd Battalion , 7th Cavalry Regiment , and two 70th Tank Battalion units ( Charlie Company and the Intelligence–Reconnaissance Platoon ) effected the " Pusan Perimeter Breakout " through 106.4 miles ( 171.2 km ) of enemy territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan . The X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul , thus threatening to trap the main KPA force in Southern Korea .
In general , avian influenza is a disease of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people ; however , people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern in areas such as Southeast Asia , where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected . The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic .
Independent service is a special service mode found on most elevators . It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralized control panel in the lobby . When an elevator is placed on independent service , it will no longer respond to hall calls . ( In a bank of elevators , traffic is rerouted to the other elevators , while in a single elevator , the hall buttons are disabled ) . The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel . Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors .
Melbourne 's rich and diverse literary history was recognised in 2008 when it became the second UNESCO City of Literature . The State Library of Victoria is one of Australia 's oldest cultural institutions and one of many public and university libraries across the city . Melbourne also has Australia 's widest range of bookstores , as well the nation 's largest publishing sector . The city is home to significant writers ' festivals , most notably the Melbourne Writers Festival . Several major literary prizes are open to local writers including the Melbourne Prize for Literature and the Victorian Premier 's Literary Awards . Significant novels set in Melbourne include Fergus Hume 's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab , Helen Garner 's Monkey Grip and Christos Tsiolkas ' The Slap . Notable writers and poets from Melbourne include Thomas Browne , C. J. Dennis , Germaine Greer and Peter Carey .
In Mark , Jesus is crucified along with two rebels , and the day goes dark for three hours . Jesus calls out to God , then gives a shout and dies . The curtain of the Temple is torn in two . Matthew follows Mark , adding an earthquake and the resurrection of saints . Luke also follows Mark , though he describes the rebels as common criminals , one of whom defends Jesus , who in turn promises that he ( Jesus ) and the criminal will be together in paradise . Luke portrays Jesus as impassive in the face of his crucifixion . John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark , though they are treated differently .
On January 8 , 2004 , Hewlett-Packard ( HP ) announced that they would sell HP-branded iPods under a license agreement from Apple . Several new retail channels were used—including Wal-Mart—and these iPods eventually made up 5 % of all iPod sales . In July 2005 , HP stopped selling iPods due to unfavorable terms and conditions imposed by Apple .
John initially adopted a defensive posture similar to that of 1199 : avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles . John 's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed , and Philip began to make steady progress in the east . John became aware in July that Arthur 's forces were threatening his mother , Eleanor , at Mirebeau Castle . Accompanied by William de Roches , his seneschal in Anjou , he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her . His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau . With his southern flank weakening , Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John 's army .
Congress has the sole power to legislate for the United States . Under the nondelegation doctrine , Congress may not delegate its lawmaking responsibilities to any other agency . In this vein , the Supreme Court held in the 1998 case Clinton v. City of New York that Congress could not delegate a " line-item veto " to the President , by powers vested in the government by the Constitution .
The central oscillator generates a self-sustaining rhythm and is driven by two interacting feedback loops that are active at different times of day . The morning loop consists of CCA1 ( Circadian and Clock-Associated 1 ) and LHY ( Late Elongated Hypocotyl ) , which encode closely related MYB transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis , as well as PRR 7 and 9 ( Pseudo-Response Regulators . ) The evening loop consists of GI ( Gigantea ) and ELF4 , both involved in regulation of flowering time genes . When CCA1 and LHY are overexpressed ( under constant light or dark conditions ) , plants become arrhythmic , and mRNA signals reduce , contributing to a negative feedback loop . Gene expression of CCA1 and LHY oscillates and peaks in the early morning , whereas TOC1 gene expression oscillates and peaks in the early evening . While it was previously hypothesised that these three genes model a negative feedback loop in which over-expressed CCA1 and LHY repress TOC1 and over-expressed TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY , it was shown in 2012 by Andrew Millar and others that TOC1 in fact serves as a repressor not only of CCA1 , LHY , and PRR7 and 9 in the morning loop but also of GI and ELF4 in the evening loop . This finding and further computational modeling of TOC1 gene functions and interactions suggest a reframing of the plant circadian clock as a triple negative-component repressilator model rather than the positive/negative-element feedback loop characterizing the clock in mammals .
According to the American National Standards Institute , pitch is the auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high . Since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency , it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity , or amplitude , of the wave . That is , " high " pitch means very rapid oscillation , and " low " pitch corresponds to slower oscillation . Despite that , the idiom relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages . At least in English , it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down . The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear . There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or decreased .
Prince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African-Americans . In 1775 , an African-American named Prince Hall , along with fourteen other African-Americans , was initiated into a British military lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland , having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in Boston . When the military Lodge left North America , those fifteen men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge , but not to initiate Masons . In 1784 , these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Premier Grand Lodge of England ( GLE ) and formed African Lodge , Number 459 . When the UGLE was formed in 1813 , all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – due largely to the War of 1812 . Thus , separated from both UGLE and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge , African Lodge re-titled itself as the African Lodge , Number 1 – and became a de facto " Grand Lodge " ( this Lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of Africa ) . As with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry , Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised on a Grand Lodge system for each state .
Kim Philby , a Soviet double agent , was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s . Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict . He later joined MI6 during World War II , was promoted into senior positions after the war ended , then eventually defected to the Soviet Union in 1963 .
The group changed their name to Destiny 's Child in 1996 , based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah . In 1997 , Destiny 's Child released their major label debut song " Killing Time " on the soundtrack to the 1997 film , Men in Black . The following year , the group released their self-titled debut album , scoring their first major hit " No , No , No " . The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry , with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R & B/Soul Album of the Year , Best R & B/Soul or Rap New Artist , and Best R & B/Soul Single for " No , No , No " . The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing 's on the Wall in 1999 . The record features some of the group 's most widely known songs such as " Bills , Bills , Bills " , the group 's first number-one single , " Jumpin ' Jumpin ' " and " Say My Name " , which became their most successful song at the time , and would remain one of their signature songs . " Say My Name " won the Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R & B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards . The Writing 's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide . During this time , Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson , an original member of Boyz II Men , on the song " After All Is Said and Done " for the soundtrack to the 1999 film , The Best Man .
In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central-government and commandery-level minting ; he also introduced a new coin . Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC , but a year later he abandoned the ban liangs entirely in favor of the wuzhu ( 五銖 ) coin , weighing 3.2 g ( 0.11 oz ) . The wuzhu became China 's standard coin until the Tang dynasty ( 618–907 AD ) . Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang 's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu .
It was also the exclusive carrier of Canadian Curling Association events during the 2004–2005 season . Due to disappointing results and fan outrage over many draws being carried on CBC Country Canada ( now called Cottage Life Television , the association tried to cancel its multiyear deal with the CBC signed in 2004 . After the CBC threatened legal action , both sides eventually came to an agreement under which early-round rights reverted to TSN . On June 15 , 2006 , the CCA announced that TSN would obtain exclusive rights to curling broadcasts in Canada as of the 2008-09 season , shutting the CBC out of the championship weekend for the first time in 40-plus years .
Rumors began swirling with regards to bringing the AFL back to Austin and San Antonio , Texas . Both cities have hosted franchises in the past ( Austin Wranglers , San Antonio Force and San Antonio Talons ) , but an AFL spokesman , BJ Pickard , was quoted as saying , " News to me . " Announcements have yet to be made on any sort of expansion plans . An expected " big announcement " on Friday , October 30 at a San Antonio Spurs game never came to fruition .
In summer of 1986 , Queen went on their final tour with Freddie Mercury . A sold-out tour in support of A Kind of Magic , once again they hired Spike Edney , leading to him being dubbed the unofficial fifth member . The Magic Tour 's highlight was at Wembley Stadium in London and resulted in the live double album , Queen at Wembley , released on CD and as a live concert DVD , which has gone five times platinum in the US and four times platinum in the UK . Queen could not book Wembley for a third night , but they did play at Knebworth Park . The show sold out within two hours and over 120,000 fans packed the park for what was Queen 's final live performance with Mercury . Queen began the tour at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm , Sweden , and during the tour the band performed a concert at Slane Castle , Ireland , in front of an audience of 95,000 , which broke the venue 's attendance record . The band also played behind the Iron Curtain when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 at the Népstadion in Budapest , in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe . More than one million people saw Queen on the tour—400,000 in the United Kingdom alone , a record at the time .
Russian border troops were stationed along the Tajik–Afghan border until summer 2005 . Since the September 11 , 2001 attacks , French troops have been stationed at the Dushanbe Airport in support of air operations of NATO 's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . United States Army and Marine Corps personnel periodically visit Tajikistan to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks duration . The Government of India rebuilt the Ayni Air Base , a military airport located 15 km southwest of Dushanbe , at a cost of $ 70 million , completing the repairs in September 2010 . It is now the main base of the Tajikistan air force . There have been talks with Russia concerning use of the Ayni facility , and Russia continues to maintain a large base on the outskirts of Dushanbe .
In 1832 , South Carolina passed an ordinance of nullification , a procedure by which a state could , in effect , repeal a federal law ; it was directed against the most recent tariff acts . Soon , federal soldiers were dispensed to Charleston 's forts , and five United States Coast Guard cutters were detached to Charleston Harbor " to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port , and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with . " This federal action became known as the Charleston incident . The state 's politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs .
San Diego was ranked as the 20th-safest city in America in 2013 by Business Insider . According to Forbes magazine , San Diego was the ninth-safest city in the top 10 list of safest cities in the U.S. in 2010 . Like most major cities , San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000 . Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s . In 2004 , San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents . From 2002 to 2006 , the crime rate overall dropped 0.8 % , though not evenly by category . While violent crime decreased 12.4 % during this period , property crime increased 1.1 % . Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008 .
The eusocial insects build nest , guard eggs , and provide food for offspring full-time ( see Eusociality ) . Most insects , however , lead short lives as adults , and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates . A small number exhibit some form of parental care , where they will at least guard their eggs , and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood , and possibly even feeding them . Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest ( a burrow or an actual construction , either of which may be simple or complex ) , store provisions in it , and lay an egg upon those provisions . The adult does not contact the growing offspring , but it nonetheless does provide food . This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps .
The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection , but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed . Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with , but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives , and then sliced apart for examination of the interior . Visually , the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter , with a dark color , separated by areas of white matter , with a lighter color . Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations . It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope , and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another .
The map of earthquake intensity published by CEA after surveying 500,000 km2 of the affected area shows a maximum liedu of XI on the China Seismic Intensity Scale ( CSIS ) , described as " very destructive " on the European Macroseismic Scale ( EMS ) from which CSIS drew reference . ( USGS , using the Modified Mercalli intensity scale ( CC ) , also placed maximum intensity at XI , " very disastrous " . ) Two south-west-north-east stripes of liedu XI are centered around Yingxiu , Wenchuan ( the town closest to the epicenter of the main quake ) and Beichuan ( the town repeatedly struck by strong aftershocks including one registering MS 6.1 on Aug 1 , 2008 ) , both in Sichuan Province , occupying a total of 2,419 km2 . The Yingxiu liedu-XI zone is about 66 km long and 20 km wide along Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou ; the Beichuan liedu-XI zone is about 82 km long and 15 km wide along An County–Beichuan–Pingwu . The area with liedu X ( comparable to X on EMS , " destructive " and X on MM , " disastrous " ) spans 3,144 km2 . The area affected by earthquakes exceeding liedu VI totals 440,442 km2 , occupying an oval 936 km long and 596 km wide , spanning three provinces and one autonomous region .
The simplest model capacitor consists of two thin parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric with permittivity ε . This model may also be used to make qualitative predictions for other device geometries . The plates are considered to extend uniformly over an area A and a charge density ±ρ = ±Q/A exists on their surface . Assuming that the length and width of the plates are much greater than their separation d , the electric field near the centre of the device will be uniform with the magnitude E = ρ/ε . The voltage is defined as the line integral of the electric field between the plates
Albert Einstein is known for his theories of special relativity and general relativity . He also made important contributions to statistical mechanics , especially his mathematical treatment of Brownian motion , his resolution of the paradox of specific heats , and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation . Despite his reservations about its interpretation , Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and , indirectly , quantum field theory , primarily through his theoretical studies of the photon .
Frédéric François Chopin ( /ˈʃoʊpæn/ ; French pronunciation : ​ [ fʁe.de.ʁik fʁɑ̃.swa ʃɔ.pɛ̃ ] ; 22 February or 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849 ) , born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin , [ n 1 ] was a Polish and French ( by citizenship and birth of father ) composer and a virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era , who wrote primarily for the solo piano . He gained and has maintained renown worldwide as one of the leading musicians of his era , whose " poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation . " Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw , and grew up in Warsaw , which after 1815 became part of Congress Poland . A child prodigy , he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20 , less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising .
As a protector and founder , Apollo had the epithets Alexicacus ( /əˌlɛksᵻˈkeɪkəs/ ə-LEK-si-KAY-kəs ; Ἀλεξίκακος , Alexikakos , literally " warding off evil " ) , Apotropaeus ( /əˌpɒtrəˈpiːəs/ ə-POT-rə-PEE-əs ; Ἀποτρόπαιος , Apotropaios , from ἀποτρέπειν , " to avert " ) , and Epicurius ( /ˌɛpᵻˈkjʊriəs/ EP-i-KEWR-ee-əs ; Ἐπικούριος , Epikourios , from ἐπικουρέειν , " to aid " ) , and Archegetes ( /ɑːrˈkɛdʒətiːz/ ar-KEJ-ə-teez ; Ἀρχηγέτης , Arkhēgetēs , literally " founder " ) , Clarius ( /ˈklæriəs/ KLARR-ee-əs ; Κλάριος , Klārios , from Doric κλάρος , " allotted lot " ) , and Genetor ( /ˈdʒɛnᵻtər/ JEN-i-tər ; Γενέτωρ , Genetōr , literally " ancestor " ) . To the Romans , he was known in this capacity as Averruncus ( /ˌævəˈrʌŋkəs/ AV-ər-RUNG-kəs ; from Latin āverruncare , " to avert " ) . He was also called Agyieus ( /əˈdʒaɪ.ᵻjuːs/ ə-GWEE-ews ; Ἀγυιεύς , Aguīeus , from ἄγυια , " street " ) for his role in protecting roads and homes ; and Nomius ( /ˈnoʊmiəs/ NOH-mee-əs ; Νόμιος , Nomios , literally " pastoral " ) and Nymphegetes ( /nɪmˈfɛdʒᵻtiːz/ nim-FEJ-i-teez ; Νυμφηγέτης , Numphēgetēs , from Νύμφη , " Nymph " , and ἡγέτης , " leader " ) for his role as a protector of shepherds and pastoral life .
In contrast to the general American Jewish community , which is dwindling due to low fertility and high intermarriage and assimilation rates , the Orthodox Jewish community of the United States is growing rapidly . Among Orthodox Jews , the fertility rate stands at about 4.1 children per family , as compared to 1.9 children per family among non-Orthodox Jews , and intermarriage among Orthodox Jews is practically non-existent , standing at about 2 % , in contrast to a 71 % intermarriage rate among non-Orthodox Jews . In addition , Orthodox Judaism has a growing retention rate ; while about half of those raised in Orthodox homes previously abandoned Orthodox Judaism , that number is declining . According to The New York Times , the high growth rate of Orthodox Jews will eventually render them the dominant demographic force in New York Jewry .
Portuguese natives comprise a very small percentage of Guinea-Bissauans . After Guinea-Bissau gained independence , most of the Portuguese nationals left the country . The country has a tiny Chinese population . These include traders and merchants of mixed Portuguese and Chinese ancestry from Macau , a former Asian Portuguese colony .
Some regions beyond the Ottoman Porte were included . One was North Africa west of Egypt . It was occupied by piratical kingdoms of the Barbary Coast , de facto independent since the 18th century . Formerly part of the empire at its apogee . Iran was included because it could not easily be reached except through the Ottoman Empire or neighboring Russia . In the 1890s the term tended to focus on the conflicts in the Balkan states and Armenia . The demise of the sick man of Europe left considerable confusion as to what was to be meant by " Near East " . It is now generally used only in historical contexts , to describe the countries of Western Asia from the Mediterranean to ( or including ) Iran . There is , in short , no universally understood fixed inventory of nations , languages or historical assets defined to be in it .
Bath Rugby play at the Recreation Ground in Bath , and the Somerset County Cricket Club are based at the County Ground in Taunton . The county gained its first Football League club in 2003 , when Yeovil Town won promotion to Division Three as Football Conference champions . They had achieved numerous FA Cup victories over football League sides in the past 50 years , and since joining the elite they have won promotion again—as League Two champions in 2005 . They came close to yet another promotion in 2007 , when they reached the League One playoff final , but lost to Blackpool at the newly reopened Wembley Stadium . Yeovil achieved promotion to the Championship in 2013 after beating Brentford in the playoff final . Horse racing courses are at Taunton and Wincanton .
The original Charter of 1837 set out the purpose of the Royal Institute to be : '… the general advancement of Civil Architecture , and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith… '
The Noble Eightfold Path—the fourth of the Buddha 's Noble Truths—consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions , that when developed together , lead to the cessation of dukkha . These eight factors are : Right View ( or Right Understanding ) , Right Intention ( or Right Thought ) , Right Speech , Right Action , Right Livelihood , Right Effort , Right Mindfulness , and Right Concentration .
During the Hellenistic period , many different schools of thought developed . Athens , with its multiple philosophical schools , continued to remain the center of philosophical thought . However Athens had now lost her political freedom and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period . In this political climate , Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia ( un-disturbedness ) , autarky ( self-sufficiency ) and apatheia ( freedom from suffering ) , which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune . This occupation with the inner life , with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common .
After the 1980s , the use of the " Canadian Armed Forces " name gave way to " Canadian Forces " ; [ citation needed ] The " Canadian Armed Forces " name returned in 2013 .
In addition to numerous articles on mathematics , Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject : A Treatise on Universal Algebra ( 1898 ) , Principia Mathematica ( co-written with Bertrand Russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913 ) , and An Introduction to Mathematics ( 1911 ) . The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians , while the latter book was intended for a larger audience , covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations . Principia Mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century .
The Hellenistic states of Asia and Egypt were run by an occupying imperial elite of Greco-Macedonian administrators and governors propped up by a standing army of mercenaries and a small core of Greco-Macedonian settlers . Promotion of immigration from Greece was important in the establishment of this system . Hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution . Macedonian and Hellenistic monarchs were expected to lead their armies on the field , along with a group of privileged aristocratic companions or friends ( hetairoi , philoi ) which dined and drank with the king and acted as his advisory council . Another role that was expected the monarch fill was that of charitable patron of his people , this public philanthropy could mean building projects and handing out gifts but also promotion of Greek culture and religion .
The Qing dynasty ( 1644–1911 ) was founded after the fall of the Ming , the last Han Chinese dynasty , by the Manchus . The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens . When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng 's peasant rebels in 1644 , the Chongzhen Emperor , the last Ming emperor , committed suicide . The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing , which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty . The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper . Schoppa , the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues , " A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality ' . It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . "
Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae was the most influential , having influenced later medieval chemists and alchemists such as Vincent of Beauvais . However Anawati argues ( following Ruska ) that the de Anima is a fake by a Spanish author . Similarly the Declaratio is believed not to be actually by Avicenna . The third work ( The Book of Minerals ) is agreed to be Avicenna 's writing , adapted from the Kitab al-Shifa ( Book of the Remedy ) . Ibn Sina classified minerals into stones , fusible substances , sulfurs , and salts , building on the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir . The epistola de Re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy ; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna , but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible .
The word " mammal " is modern , from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 , derived from the Latin mamma ( " teat , pap " ) . All female mammals nurse their young with milk , which is secreted from special glands , the mammary glands . According to Mammal Species of the World , 5,416 species were known in 2006 . These were grouped in 1,229 genera , 153 families and 29 orders . In 2008 the IUCN completed a five-year , 1,700-scientist Global Mammal Assessment for its IUCN Red List , which counted 5,488 accepted species .
The head of state of Delhi is the Lieutenant Governor of the Union Territory of Delhi , appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Central government and the post is largely ceremonial , as the Chief Minister of the Union Territory of Delhi is the head of government and is vested with most of the executive powers . According to the Indian constitution , if a law passed by Delhi 's legislative assembly is repugnant to any law passed by the Parliament of India , then the law enacted by the parliament will prevail over the law enacted by the assembly .
Forms of corruption vary , but include bribery , extortion , cronyism , nepotism , gombeenism , parochialism patronage , influence peddling , graft , and embezzlement . Corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking , money laundering , and human trafficking , though is not restricted to these activities . Misuse of government power for other purposes , such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality , is also considered political corruption .
Samskrita Bharati is an organisation working for Sanskrit revival . The " All-India Sanskrit Festival " ( since 2002 ) holds composition contests . The 1991 Indian census reported 49,736 fluent speakers of Sanskrit . Sanskrit learning programmes also feature on the lists of most AIR broadcasting centres . The Mattur village in central Karnataka claims to have native speakers of Sanskrit among its population . Inhabitants of all castes learn Sanskrit starting in childhood and converse in the language . Even the local Muslims converse in Sanskrit . Historically , the village was given by king Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire to Vedic scholars and their families , while people in his kingdom spoke Kannada and Telugu . Another effort concentrates on preserving and passing along the oral tradition of the Vedas , www.shrivedabharathi.in is one such organisation based out of Hyderabad that has been digitising the Vedas by recording recitations of Vedic Pandits .
The Guangxu Emperor died on November 14 , 1908 , and on November 15 , 1908 , Cixi also died . Rumors held that she or Yuan Shikai ordered trusted eunuchs to poison the Guangxu Emperor , and an autopsy conducted nearly a century later confirmed lethal levels of arsenic in his corpse . Puyi , the oldest son of Zaifeng , Prince Chun , and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor , was appointed successor at the age of two , leaving Zaifeng with the regency . This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power . In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers . Nonetheless , this cabinet was also known by contemporaries as " The Royal Cabinet " because among the thirteen cabinet members , five were members of the imperial family or Aisin Gioro relatives . This brought a wide range of negative opinions from senior officials like Zhang Zhidong . The Wuchang Uprising of October 10 , 1911 , led to the creation of a new central government , the Republic of China , in Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head . Many provinces soon began " separating " from Qing control . Seeing a desperate situation unfold , the Qing government brought Yuan Shikai back to military power . He took control of his Beiyang Army to crush the revolution in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia . After taking the position of Prime Minister and creating his own cabinet , Yuan Shikai went as far as to ask for the removal of Zaifeng from the regency . This removal later proceeded with directions from Empress Dowager Longyu .
The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically . The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets , like the ancient murrelet , leave the nest the night after they hatch , following their parents out to sea , where they are raised away from terrestrial predators . Some other species , such as ducks , move their chicks away from the nest at an early age . In most species , chicks leave the nest just before , or soon after , they are able to fly . The amount of parental care after fledging varies ; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help , while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging . Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration .
The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire is the " order of chivalry of British constitutional monarchy " , rewarding contributions to the arts and sciences , work with charitable and welfare organisations and public service outside the Civil Service . It was established on 4 June 1917 by King George V , and comprises five classes , in civil and military divisions , the most senior two of which make the recipient either a knight if male , or dame if female . There is also the related British Empire Medal , whose recipients are affiliated with , but not members of , the order .
In 677 ( during the reign of Emperor Gaozong ) , Chen Zheng ( 陳政 ) , together with his son Chen Yuanguang ( 陳元光 ) , led a military expedition to pacify the rebellion in Fujian . They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou ; In 885 , ( during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang ) , the two brothers Wang Chao ( 王潮 ) and Wang Shenzhi ( 王審知 ) , led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion . They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou . These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region . This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect .
One of the most popular shows on CBC Television is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of NHL hockey games , Hockey Night in Canada . It has been televised by the network since 1952 . During the NHL lockout and subsequent cancellation of the 2004-2005 hockey season , CBC instead aired various recent and classic movies , branded as Movie Night in Canada , on Saturday nights . Many cultural groups criticized this and suggested the CBC air games from minor hockey leagues ; the CBC responded that most such broadcast rights were already held by other groups , but it did base each Movie Night broadcast from a different Canadian hockey venue . Other than hockey , CBC Sports properties include Toronto Raptors basketball , Toronto FC Soccer , and various other amateur and professional events .
Writing to a friend in May 1795 , Burke surveyed the causes of discontent : " I think I can hardly overrate the malignity of the principles of Protestant ascendency , as they affect Ireland ; or of Indianism [ i.e . corporate tyranny , as practiced by the British East Indies Company ] , as they affect these countries , and as they affect Asia ; or of Jacobinism , as they affect all Europe , and the state of human society itself . The last is the greatest evil " . By March 1796 , however Burke had changed his mind : " Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies , which are sapping its foundations , Indianism , and Jacobinism . In some Cases they act separately , in some they act in conjunction : But of this I am sure ; that the first is the worst by far , and the hardest to deal with ; and for this amongst other reasons , that it weakens discredits , and ruins that force , which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other ; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all formal Government " .
An influential school of phonology in the interwar period was the Prague school . One of its leading members was Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy , whose Grundzüge der Phonologie ( Principles of Phonology ) , published posthumously in 1939 , is among the most important works in the field from this period . Directly influenced by Baudouin de Courtenay , Trubetzkoy is considered the founder of morphophonology , although this concept had also been recognized by de Courtenay . Trubetzkoy also developed the concept of the archiphoneme . Another important figure in the Prague school was Roman Jakobson , who was one of the most prominent linguists of the 20th century .
In 1907 , the newly established Board of Education found that greater capacity for higher technical education was needed and a proposal to merge the City and Guilds College , the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science was approved and passed , creating The Imperial College of Science and Technology as a constituent college of the University of London . Imperial 's Royal Charter , granted by Edward VII , was officially signed on 8 July 1907 . The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute in South Kensington .
In 1967 , a new U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) combined major federal responsibilities for air and surface transport . The Federal Aviation Agency 's name changed to the Federal Aviation Administration as it became one of several agencies ( e.g. , Federal Highway Administration , Federal Railroad Administration , the Coast Guard , and the Saint Lawrence Seaway Commission ) within DOT ( albeit the largest ) . The FAA administrator would no longer report directly to the president but would instead report to the Secretary of Transportation . New programs and budget requests would have to be approved by DOT , which would then include these requests in the overall budget and submit it to the president .
The changes included a new corporate color palette , small modifications to the GE logo , a new customized font ( GE Inspira ) and a new slogan , " Imagination at work " , composed by David Lucas , to replace the slogan " We Bring Good Things to Life " used since 1979 . The standard requires many headlines to be lowercased and adds visual " white space " to documents and advertising . The changes were designed by Wolff Olins and are used on GE 's marketing , literature and website . In 2014 , a second typeface family was introduced : GE Sans and Serif by Bold Monday created under art direction by Wolff Olins .
Anti-miscegenation laws were passed in most states during the 18th , 19th and early 20th centuries , but this did not prevent white slaveholders , their sons , or other powerful white men from taking slave women as concubines and having multiracial children with them . In California and the western US , there were greater numbers of Latino and Asian residents . These were prohibited from official relationships with whites . White legislators passed laws prohibiting marriage between European and Asian Americans until the 1950s .
According to mtDNA studies by Holden ( 2005 ) and Richards et al . ( 2006 ) , a significant proportion of the maternal lineages of Somalis consists of the M1 haplogroup . This mitochondrial clade is common among Ethiopians and North Africans , particularly Egyptians and Algerians . M1 is believed to have originated in Asia , where its parent M clade represents the majority of mtDNA lineages . This haplogroup is also thought to possibly correlate with the Afro-Asiatic language family :
Crevasses can form in several different ways . Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate . Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally . Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier , due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls . Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow . Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above , forming a bergschrund . Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier 's margins .
The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons . The next contract , negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season , rose to £670 million over four seasons . The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04 . The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07 . It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis . Sky 's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available . This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company . Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7 billion , a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth . Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers . The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons ( on Match of the Day ) for £171.6 million , a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period . Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games ( that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet ) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday . Overseas television rights fetched £625 million , nearly double the previous contract . The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7 billion , giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010 .
There is also a widespread view [ vague ] [ who ? ] that giving much more financial support to continuously cover the debt crisis or allow even higher budget deficits or debt levels would discourage the crisis states to implement necessary reforms to regain their competitiveness . [ citation needed ] There has also been a reluctance [ citation needed ] of financially stable eurozone states like Germany [ citation needed ] to further circumvent the no-bailout clause in the EU contracts and to generally take on the burden of financing or guaranteeing the debts of financially unstable or defaulting eurozone countries .

The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction until late in the 20th century , replacing the phonograph cylinder record–with which it had co-existed from the late 1880s through to the 1920s–by the late 1920s . Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed . By the late 1980s , digital media , in the form of the compact disc , had gained a larger market share , and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991 . From the 1990s to the 2010s , records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale , and were especially used by disc jockeys ( DJ ) s , released by artists in some genres , and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles . The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014 , a 260 % increase since 2009 . Likewise , in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014 .
Every federal unit had a town or city with historic significance from the World War II period renamed to have Tito 's name included . The largest of these was Titograd , now Podgorica , the capital city of Montenegro . With the exception of Titograd , the cities were renamed simply by the addition of the adjective " Tito 's " ( " Titov " ) . The cities were :
One of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina , whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage . Medina was cut in the Top 40 round . Casey Abrams , who suffers from ulcerative colitis , was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show . The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11 , and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10 . In the following week , Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated the following week .
After the Baltic states were forced to accept treaties , Stalin turned his sights on Finland , confident that Finnish capitulation could be attained without great effort . The Soviets demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus , the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki , which Finland rejected . The Soviets staged the shelling of Mainila and used it as a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact . The Red Army attacked in November 1939 . Simultaneously , Stalin set up a puppet government in the Finnish Democratic Republic . [ clarification needed ] The leader of the Leningrad Military District Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Dmitri Shostakovich , entitled " Suite on Finnish Themes " to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through Helsinki . After Finnish defenses surprisingly held out for over three months while inflicting stiff losses on Soviet forces , the Soviets settled for an interim peace . Finland ceded southeastern areas of Karelia ( 10 % of Finnish territory ) , which resulted in approximately 422,000 Karelians ( 12 % of Finland 's population ) losing their homes . Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000 , although Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million .
A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia ( episcopal regalia : mitre , crozier , zucchetto , pectoral cross and ring ) . Even if not a bishop , any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs , as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals , but he can not perform the functions reserved solely to bishops , such as ordination . The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it , and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves .
Schwarzenegger 's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world , which meant becoming Mr. Olympia . His first attempt was in 1969 , when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva . However , Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition , making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23 , a record he still holds to this day .
Hidalgo was turned over to the Bishop of Durango , Francisco Gabriel de Olivares , for an official defrocking and excommunication on July 27 , 1811 . He was then found guilty of treason by a military court and executed by firing squad on July 30 at 7 in the morning . Before his execution , he thanked his jailers , Private Soldiers Ortega and Melchor , in letters for their humane treatment . At his execution , Hidalgo placed his right hand over his heart to show the riflemen where they should aim . He also refused the use of a blindfold . His body , along with the bodies of Allende , Aldama and José Mariano Jiménez were decapitated , and the heads were put on display on the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato . The heads remained there for ten years until the end of the Mexican War of Independence to serve as a warning to other insurgents . Hidalgo 's headless body was first displayed outside the prison but then buried in the Church of St Francis in Chihuahua . Those remains would later be transferred in 1824 to Mexico City .
Burke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox 's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution . Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party " as tolerating , and by a toleration , countenancing those proceedings " so that he could " stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be ... their sentiments " . Therefore , on 3 August 1791 Burke published his Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs , in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them , as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party .
Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the Paleolithic and the Neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . [ citation needed ] Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as Olduwan or Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . [ citation needed ] Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to Culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . By making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
Because of space constraints , NARA opened a second facility , known informally as Archives II , in 1994 near the University of Maryland , College Park campus ( 8601 Adelphi Road , College Park , MD , 20740-6001 ) . Largely because of this proximity , NARA and the University of Maryland engage in cooperative initiatives . The College Park campus includes an archaeological site that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 .
In June 2014 , Universal Partnerships took over licensing consumer products for NBC and Sprout with expectation that all licensing would eventually be centralized within NBCUniversal . In May 2015 , Gramercy Pictures was revived by Focus Features as a genre label , that concentrated on action , sci-fi , and horror films .
Alexander faced pressure from his brother , Duke Constantine , to make peace with Napoleon . Given the victory he had just achieved , the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms–demanding that Russia join the Continental System , withdraw its forces from Wallachia and Moldavia , and hand over the Ionian Islands to France . By contrast , Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia , despite the ceaseless exhortations of Queen Louise . Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map , Napoleon created a new kingdom of 1,100 square miles called Westphalia . He then appointed his young brother Jérôme as the new monarch of this kingdom . Prussia 's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the Napoleonic era progressed . Moreover , Alexander 's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart , who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years . Despite these problems , the Treaties of Tilsit at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France , which he had not seen in over 300 days .
The National Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) , located in Mexico City , is the largest university on the continent , with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds . Three Nobel laureates , several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico 's modern-day presidents are among its former students . UNAM conducts 50 % of Mexico 's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses , observatories and research centres . UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education ( then called Times Higher Education Supplement ) in 2006 , making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world . The sprawling main campus of the university , known as Ciudad Universitaria , was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007 .
Among the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches , in which some Presbyterians are involved , clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble , but also cassock and surplice ( typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb , an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite ) , which some , particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement , hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past .
A number of universities in London are outside the University of London system , including Brunel University , City University London , Imperial College London , Kingston University , London Metropolitan University , Middlesex University , University of East London , University of West London and University of Westminster , ( with over 34,000 students , the largest unitary university in London ) , London South Bank University , Middlesex University , University of the Arts London ( the largest university of art , design , fashion , communication and the performing arts in Europe ) , University of East London , the University of West London and the University of Westminster . In addition there are three international universities in London – Regent 's University London , Richmond , The American International University in London and Schiller International University .
Before the latter half of the 18th century , grain , timber and then coal were Plymouth 's main imports . During this time the real source of wealth was from the neighbouring town of Plymouth Dock ( renamed in 1824 to Devonport ) and the major employer in the entire region was the dockyard . The Three Towns conurbation of Plymouth , Stonehouse and Devonport enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th century and were enriched by a series of neo-classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston . Foulston was important for both Devonport and Plymouth and was responsible for several grand public buildings , many now destroyed , including the Athenaeum , the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel , and much of Union Street .
Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism : for instance , worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers . In vertebrates , the reward-punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures , at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia , a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain . There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made : the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain ; when this inhibition is released , a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out . Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted . The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism , because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively . Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role : addictive drugs such as cocaine , amphetamine , and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced .
Alpine plants such the Alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the Lauterbrunnental . Gentians are named after the Illyrian king Gentius , and 40 species of the early-spring blooming flower grow in the Alps , in a range of 1,500 to 2,400 m ( 4,921 to 7,874 ft ) . Writing about the gentians in Switzerland D. H. Lawrence described them as " darkening the day-time , torch-like with the smoking blueness of Pluto 's gloom . " Gentians tend to " appear " repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates , moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys . On the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer .
The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company ( CTR ) through the consolidation of The Tabulating Machine Company , the International Time Recording Company , the Computing Scale Company and the Bundy Manufacturing Company . CTR was renamed " International Business Machines " in 1924 , a name which Thomas J. Watson first used for a CTR Canadian subsidiary . The initialism IBM followed . Securities analysts nicknamed the company Big Blue for its size and common use of the color in products , packaging and its logo .
The most common way for travellers to enter the country seems to be by air . According to the website Lonely Planet , getting into Myanmar is problematic : " No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country , nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border – you must walk across . " , and states that , " It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river . " There are a small number of border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles , such as the border between Ruili ( China ) to Mu-se , the border between Htee Kee ( Myanmar ) and Ban Phu Nam Ron ( Thailand ) ( the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi ) , and the border between Myawaddy ( Myanmar ) and Mae Sot ( Thailand ) . At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013 . " From Mae Sai ( Thailand ) you can cross to Tachileik , but can only go as far as Kengtung . Those in Thailand on a visa run can cross to Kawthaung but can not venture farther into Myanmar . "
Four years into the 20th century saw the Russo-Japanese War with the Battle of Port Arthur establishing the Empire of Japan as a world power . The Russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean , for their navy as well as for maritime trade . The Manchurian Campaign of the Russian Empire was fought against the Japanese over Manchuria and Korea . The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria , specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden , and the seas around Korea , Japan , and the Yellow Sea . The resulting campaigns , in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them , were unexpected by world observers . These victories , as time transpired , would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia , resulting in a reassessment of Japan 's recent entry onto the world stage . The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government .
Although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary , the 1968 archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem of the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels . The crucified man was identified as Yehohanan ben Hagkol and probably died about 70 AD , around the time of the Jewish revolt against Rome . The analyses at the Hadassah Medical School estimated that he died in his late 20s . Another relevant archaeological find , which also dates to the 1st century AD , is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite , now held by the Israel Antiquities Authority and displayed in the Israel Museum .
Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism , that the reality is composed of four substances ( earth , water , air , fire ) . Each of these four are of two types : atomic ( paramāṇu ) and composite . An atom is , according to Vaiśeṣika scholars , that which is indestructible ( anitya ) , indivisible , and has a special kind of dimension , called “ small ” ( aṇu ) . A composite , in this philosophy , is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms . Whatever human beings perceive is composite , while atoms are invisible . The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size , form , truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms , their number and their spatial arrangements , their guṇa ( quality ) , karma ( activity ) , sāmānya ( commonness ) , viśeṣa ( particularity ) and amavāya ( inherence , inseparable connectedness of everything ) .
The Zhengde Emperor ( r. 1505–1521 ) , who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate , had heard tales of a " living Buddha " which he desired to host at the Ming capital ; this was none other than the Rinpung-supported Mikyö Dorje , 8th Karmapa Lama then occupying Lhasa . Zhengde 's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court , arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox . Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu , in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery on a mission to invite this Karmapa to Beijing . Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze , consuming 2,835 g ( 100 oz ) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan . After procurring necessary gifts for the mission , he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000 troops . When the request was delivered , the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him . The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun 's camp , seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun 's entire escort . After this fiasco , Liu fled for his life , but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died .
The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s . Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and can not be considered synthetic , but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process , and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials . A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades . Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924 . Nylon , the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals , was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936 , followed by DuPont 's acrylic in 1944 . Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers , such as women 's hosiery from nylon , but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat . The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies , especially in Central American countries , such as Nicaragua , where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides . Cotton production recovered in the 1970s , but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s .
The RIBA is a member organisation , with 44,000 members . Chartered Members are entitled to call themselves chartered architects and to append the post-nominals RIBA after their name ; Student Members are not permitted to do so . Formerly , fellowships of the institute were granted , although no longer ; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA .
On September 30 , 1989 , thousands of Belorussians , denouncing local leaders , marched through Minsk to demand additional cleanup of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster site in Ukraine . Up to 15,000 protesters wearing armbands bearing radioactivity symbols and carrying the banned red-and-white Belorussian national flag filed through torrential rain in defiance of a ban by local authorities . Later , they gathered in the city center near the government 's headquarters , where speakers demanded resignation of Yefrem Sokolov , the republic 's Communist Party leader , and called for the evacuation of half a million people from the contaminated zones .
A typical protein-coding gene is first copied into RNA as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product . :6.1 In other cases , the RNA molecules are the actual functional products , as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA . Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function , and microRNA has a regulatory role . The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes .
In 1 April 2012 by-elections the NLD won 43 of the 45 available seats ; previously an illegal organisation , the NLD had never won a Burmese election until this time . The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in Myanmar . Following announcement of the by-elections , the Freedom House organisation raised concerns about " reports of fraud and harassment in the lead up to elections , including the March 23 deportation of Somsri Hananuntasuk , executive director of the Asian Network for Free Elections ( ANFREL ) , a regional network of civil society organisations promoting democratization . " However , uncertainties exist as some other political prisoners have not been released and clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups continue .
Apple has generally dominated the premium PC market , having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $ 1,000 in 2009 , according to NPD . The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012 , compared to 13 percent for Dell , seven percent for Hewlett Packard , six percent for Lenovo and Asus , and one percent for Acer . While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady , in comparison to Apple 's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s , Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis , with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs . It also helped that the Macintosh lineup is simple , updated on a yearly schedule , and consistent across both Apple retail stores , and authorized resellers where they have a special " store within a store " section to distinguish them from Windows PCs . In contrast , Windows PC manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings , selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web , and often with limited-time or region-specific models . The Macintosh ranked third on the " list of intended brands for desktop purchases " for the 2011 holiday season , then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard , and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell .
In mid-1944 Japan mobilized over 500,000 men and launched a massive operation across China under the code name Operation Ichi-Go , their largest offensive of World War II , with the goal of connecting Japanese-controlled territory in China and French Indochina and capturing airbases in southeastern China where American bombers were based . During this time , many of the newest American-trained Chinese units and supplies were forcibly locked in the Burmese theater under Joseph Stilwell set by terms of the Lend-Lease Agreement . Though Japan suffered about 100,000 casualties , these attacks , the biggest in several years , gained much ground for Japan before Chinese forces stopped the incursions in Guangxi . Despite major tactical victories , the operation overall failed to provide Japan with any significant strategic gains . A great majority of the Chinese forces were able to retreat out of the area , and later come back to attack Japanese positions such as Battle of West Hunan . Japan was not any closer in defeating China after this operation , and the constant defeats the Japanese suffered in the Pacific meant that Japan never got the time and resources needed to achieve final victory over China . Operation Ichi-go created a great sense of social confusion in the areas of China that it affected . Chinese Communist guerrillas were able to exploit this confusion to gain influence and control of greater areas of the countryside in the aftermath of Ichi-go .
The standard connectors were designed to be robust . Because USB is hot-pluggable , the connectors would be used more frequently , and perhaps with less care , than other connectors . Many previous connector designs were fragile , specifying embedded component pins or other delicate parts that were vulnerable to bending or breaking . The electrical contacts in a USB connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue , and the entire connecting assembly is usually protected by an enclosing metal sheath .
Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook , or treat the same concepts as central . Each tradition , however , does have its own core concepts , and some comparisons can be drawn between them . For example , according to one Buddhist ecumenical organization , [ web 23 ] several concepts common to both major Buddhist branches :
On 3 May 1505 King Alexander I Jagiellon granted the Act of " Nihil novi nisi commune consensu " ( Latin : " I accept nothing new except by common consent " ) . This forbade the king to pass any new law without the consent of the representatives of the nobility , in Sejm and Senat assembled , and thus greatly strengthened the nobility 's political position . Basically , this act transferred legislative power from the king to the Sejm . This date commonly marks the beginning of the First Rzeczpospolita , the period of a szlachta-run " Commonwealth " .
In March 1971 , the residential office of an FBI agent in Media , Pennsylvania was burglarized by a group calling itself the Citizens ' Commission to Investigate the FBI . Numerous files were taken and distributed to a range of newspapers , including The Harvard Crimson . The files detailed the FBI 's extensive COINTELPRO program , which included investigations into lives of ordinary citizens—including a black student group at a Pennsylvania military college and the daughter of Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin . The country was " jolted " by the revelations , which included assassinations of political activists , and the actions were denounced by members of Congress , including House Majority Leader Hale Boggs . The phones of some members of Congress , including Boggs , had allegedly been tapped .
There are 366 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network . South London , particularly , has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines . Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London , running into eighteen terminal stations , with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports . London has Britain 's busiest station by number of passengers – Waterloo , with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex ( which includes Waterloo East station ) each year . Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing .
Although the Russian Caucasus Army of Imperial forces commanded by Nikolai Yudenich and Armenians in volunteer units and Armenian militia led by Andranik Ozanian and Tovmas Nazarbekian succeeded in gaining most of Ottoman Armenia during World War I , their gains were lost with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 . [ citation needed ] At the time , Russian-controlled Eastern Armenia , Georgia , and Azerbaijan attempted to bond together in the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic . This federation , however , lasted from only February to May 1918 , when all three parties decided to dissolve it . As a result , the Dashnaktsutyun government of Eastern Armenia declared its independence on 28 May as the First Republic of Armenia under the leadership of Aram Manukian .
The Late Bronze Age ( from 1700 to 1200 BCE ) Hittite and Hurrian Aplu was a god of plague , invoked during plague years . Here we have an apotropaic situation , where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it . Aplu , meaning the son of , was a title given to the god Nergal , who was linked to the Babylonian god of the sun Shamash . Homer interprets Apollo as a terrible god ( δεινὸς θεός ) who brings death and disease with his arrows , but who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other Greek gods . In Iliad , his priest prays to Apollo Smintheus , the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats . All these functions , including the function of the healer-god Paean , who seems to have Mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of Apollo .
Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . Despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy , Benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata . The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans , and Gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . Under Idris , Libya 's armed forces were trained by the British military ; this angered Gaddafi , who viewed the British as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers , ultimately failing his exams . British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
On January 5 , 2012 , West announced his establishment of the creative content company DONDA , named after his late mother Donda West . In his announcement , West proclaimed that the company would " pick up where Steve Jobs left off " ; DONDA would operate as " a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers in a creative space to bounce their dreams and ideas " with the " goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford . " West is notoriously secretive about the company 's operations , maintaining neither an official website nor a social media presence . In stating DONDA 's creative philosophy , West articulated the need to " put creatives in a room together with like minds " in order to " simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see , taste , touch , and feel. " . Contemporary critics have noted the consistent minimalistic aesthetic exhibited throughout DONDA creative projects .
