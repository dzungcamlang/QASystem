volumetric mass density 
ρ 
D 
mass divided by volume 
weight per unit volume 
weight per unit volume 
mass concentration 
buoyancy , purity and packaging 
Osmium and iridium 
" relative density " or " specific gravity " 
substance floats in water 
temperature and pressure 
decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density 
decreases its density by increasing its volume 
convection of the heat from the bottom to the top 
the decrease in the density of the heated fluid 
specific volume 
thermodynamics 
increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density 
determining whether King Hiero 's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another , cheaper alloy 
I have found it 
indicate a moment of enlightenment 
in written form in Vitruvius' books of architecture 
among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time 
mass divided by volume 
ρ = m / V 
The SI unit of kilogram per cubic meter ( kg/m3 ) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimeter ( g/cm3 ) 
its total mass divided by its total volume 
a scale or balance 
directly ( from the geometry of the object ) or by the displacement of a fluid 
a hydrometer , a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter 
voids 
regions which contain something other than the considered material 
air , but it could also be vacuum , liquid , solid , or a different gas or gaseous mixture 
Mass divided by bulk volume 
discount the volume of the void fraction 
air , or even gaseous 
buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent 
sand is so much denser than air 
kilogram or kilogramme 
kg 
the Metric system 
being equal to the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram 
International Prototype of the Kilogram ( IPK , also known as " Le Grand K " or " Big K " ) 
both the imperial and US customary systems 
exactly 0.45359237 kg 
IPK 
1/1000 
the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at the melting point of ice 
1795 
equal to the mass of 1 dm3 of water at its maximum density , approximately 4 °C 
The kilogram 
" kilo " , symbol " k " 
the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) 
the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant 
the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface 
the SI derived unit , the cubic metre

zero 
fluid displacement 
volume is a fundamental parameter , and is a conjugate variable to pressure
