The density , or more precisely , the volumetric mass density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume . The symbol most often used for density is ρ ( the lower case Greek letter rho ) , although the Latin letter D can also be used . Mathematically , density is defined as mass divided by volume . In some cases ( for instance , in the United States oil and gas industry ) , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume , although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight .

For a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration . Different materials usually have different densities , and density may be relevant to buoyancy , purity and packaging . Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure but certain chemical compounds may be denser . To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units , it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity " relative density " or " specific gravity " , i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material , usually water . Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water .

The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure . This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases . Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density . Increasing the temperature of a substance ( with a few exceptions ) decreases its density by increasing its volume . In most materials , heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top , due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid . This causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material . The reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume , a term sometimes used in thermodynamics . Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density ; rather it increases its mass .

In a well-known but probably apocryphal tale , Archimedes was given the task of determining whether King Hiero 's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another , cheaper alloy . Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass ; but the king did not approve of this . Baffled , Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the displacement of the water . Upon this discovery , he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting , " Eureka ! Eureka ! " ( Εύρηκα ! Greek " I have found it " ) . As a result , the term " eureka " entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment . The story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius' books of architecture , two centuries after it supposedly took place . Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale , saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time .

From the equation for density ( ρ = m / V ) , mass density has units of mass divided by volume . As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use . The SI unit of kilogram per cubic meter ( kg/m3 ) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimeter ( g/cm3 ) are probably the most commonly used units for density . 1,000 kg/m3 equals 1 g/cm3 . ( The cubic centimeter can be alternately called a millilitre or a cc . ) In industry , other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and US customary units may be used . See below for a list of some of the most common units of density .

The density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume . The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance ; the volume may be measured directly ( from the geometry of the object ) or by the displacement of a fluid . To determine the density of a liquid or a gas , a hydrometer , a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used , respectively . Similarly , hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object .

In practice , bulk materials such as sugar , sand , or snow contain voids . Many materials exist in nature as flakes , pellets , or granules . Voids are regions which contain something other than the considered material . Commonly the void is air , but it could also be vacuum , liquid , solid , or a different gas or gaseous mixture . The bulk volume of a material—inclusive of the void fraction—is often obtained by a simple measurement ( e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup ) or geometrically from known dimensions . Mass divided by bulk volume determines bulk density . This is not the same thing as volumetric mass density .

To determine volumetric mass density , one must first discount the volume of the void fraction . Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning . For the close-packing of equal spheres the non-void fraction can be at most about 74% . It can also be determined empirically . Some bulk materials , however , such as sand , have a variable void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured . It might be loose or compact , with more or less air space depending on handling . In practice , the void fraction is not necessarily air , or even gaseous . In the case of sand , it could be water , which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water—once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out—is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void . In the case of non-compact materials , one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample .

If the material is under pressure ( commonly ambient air pressure at the earth' s surface ) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent , depending on how the measurement was conducted . In the case of dry sand , sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected ( less than one part in one thousand ) . Mass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction , if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known .

The kilogram or kilogramme ( SI unit symbol : kg ) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units ( SI ) ( the Metric system ) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram ( IPK , also known as " Le Grand K " or " Big K " ) . The avoirdupois ( or international ) pound , used in both the imperial and US customary systems , is defined as exactly 0.45359237 kg , making one kilogram approximately equal to 2 .2046 avoirdupois pounds . Other traditional units of weight and mass around the world are also defined in terms of the kilogram , making the IPK the primary standard for virtually all units of mass on Earth .

The gram , 1/1000 of a kilogram , was provisionally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at the melting point of ice . The final kilogram , manufactured as a prototype in 1799 and from which the IPK was derived in 1875 , had a mass equal to the mass of 1 dm3 of water at its maximum density , approximately 4 °C . The kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix ( " kilo " , symbol " k " ) as part of its name . It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by an artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced in different laboratories . Three other base units ( cd , A , mol ) and 17 derived units ( N , Pa , J , W , C , V , F , Ω , S , Wb , T , H , kat , Gy , Sv , lm , lx ) in the SI system are defined relative to the kilogram , so its stability is important . Only 8 other units do not require the kilogram in their definition : temperature ( K , °C ) , time and frequency ( s , Hz , Bq ) , length ( m ) , and angle ( rad , sr ) .

The final kilogram , manufactured as a prototype in 1799 and from which the IPK was derived in 1875 , had a mass equal to the mass of 1 dm3 of water at its maximum density , approximately 4 °C . The kilogram is the only SI base unit with an SI prefix ( " kilo " , symbol " k " ) as part of its name . It is also the only SI unit that is still directly defined by an artifact rather than a fundamental physical property that can be reproduced in different laboratories . Three other base units ( cd , A , mol ) and 17 derived units ( N , Pa , J , W , C , V , F , Ω , S , Wb , T , H , kat , Gy , Sv , lm , lx ) in the SI system are defined relative to the kilogram , so its stability is important . Only 8 other units do not require the kilogram in their definition : temperature ( K , °C ) , time and frequency ( s , Hz , Bq ) , length ( m ) , and angle ( rad , sr ) .

The International Prototype Kilogram was commissioned by the General Conference on Weights and Measures ( CGPM ) under the authority of the Metre Convention ( 1875 ) , and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ( BIPM ) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM . After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions , the International Committee for Weights and Measures ( CIPM ) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature . 
At its 2011 meeting , the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant . The decision was originally deferred until 2014 ; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting . There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition ( some of which have been abandoned ) ; these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below . The International Prototype Kilogram ( IPK ) is rarely used or handled . Copies of the IPK kept by national metrology laboratories around the world were compared with the IPK in 1889 , 1948 , and 1989 to provide traceability of measurements of mass anywhere in the world back to the IPK . 
Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface , for example , the space that a substance ( solid , liquid , gas , or plasma ) or shape occupies or contains . Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit , the cubic metre . The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container , i.e. the amount of fluid ( gas or liquid ) that the container could hold , rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces .

Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes . Volumes of some simple shapes , such as regular , straight-edged , and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas . Volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape 's boundary . Where a variance in shape and volume occurs , such as those that exist between different human beings , these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the Body Volume Index . One-dimensional figures ( such as lines ) and two-dimensional shapes ( such as squares ) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space .

The volume of a solid ( whether regularly or irregularly shaped ) can be determined by fluid displacement . Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas . The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances . However , sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additive . 
In differential geometry , volume is expressed by means of the volume form , and is an important global Riemannian invariant . In thermodynamics , volume is a fundamental parameter , and is a conjugate variable to pressure .
